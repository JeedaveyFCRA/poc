However, none of the four attachments provided contain the crucial internal notes or documentation that were specifically referenced in my prior communications with Jacob Dufurrena (via email) and Lawrence Young (via phone) regarding my denied refinance request.<br><br>To be clear, I am still seeking one of the following:<br><br>Written confirmation or summary of the internal decision-making notes from Rocket’s Credit Upgrade Department.<br>A brief written statement from either Jacob Dufurrena or Lawrence Young outlining the reason I was referred to the Credit Upgrade Department and the score or debt thresholds communicated.<br>An internal summary or transcript of my phone call with Lawrence Young, which was conducted on a recorded line, including any notes taken or decisions discussed during that conversation.<br><br>Even a short paragraph is sufficient. I am not requesting anything complicated—just a factual acknowledgment of what was discussed and documented.<br><br>As a reminder, my case involved an internal block of my refinance application due to my credit score being below 640. I was referred to the Credit Upgrade Department and advised that I would need to either:<br>Raise my score to 640+, OR<br>Pay down approximately $10,000 in debt to qualify.<br><br>This internal decision was confirmed by both Jacob Dufurrena and Lawrence Young, yet no formal record of this requirement has been provided. It is especially concerning that Rocket Mortgage appears to be withholding documentation that directly affected my ability to access credit.<br><br>Both Jacob and Lawrence were professional and helpful. Lawrence, in particular, recalled our entire conversation and referred to his notes during our call. It is clear that internal documentation exists, and I am simply asking for a copy or confirmation.<br><br>Given the seriousness of this issue—and the extensive delays—I am respectfully making this request before initiating a formal complaint with the CFPB, FTC, and other applicable regulatory agencies. These complaints will document Rocket’s refusal to produce internal records tied to a credit denial.<br><br>Please respond by April 3, 2025.<br><br>I would still prefer to resolve this cooperatively and avoid escalation. I appreciate your continued efforts and look forward to your response.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>David Marra<br><em>-end of email-</em>"
