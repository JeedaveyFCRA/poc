Please try **three different implementation approaches** and select the cleanest and most responsive one.\n\n3. **Align Badge and Text**:\n   - The Lucide icon (severity badge) should **top-align** with the description text.\n   - The icon-text gap should be reduced slightly (e.g. 8px)\n   - The text should move a few pixels **closer to the badge** and left toward the edge ‚Äî but respect the new padding.\n\nüß± SECTION 3 ‚Äî MISCELLANEOUS FIXES\n\n‚Ä¢ **Restore all three toggle buttons**:\n   - ‚ÄúFilter This Report‚Äù is currently missing its expanded-state button.\n   - ‚ÄúSeverity Summary‚Äù and ‚ÄúViolation Details‚Äù are also missing their expanded-state buttons.\n   - These three stacks should behave consistently with the new label/toggle logic.\n\n‚Ä¢ **Legal Disclaimer Text**:\n   - Shrink the font size of the footer message:\n     `‚ÄúOriginal report shown.

Count and descriptions update accordingly.\n\nTotal Violations: Shows all violations pre-tagged on all pages, even if not currently visible due to pagination.\n\nCurrent Page Only: Shows violations on the active page, filtered by their selection status. If no vioboxes are selected on this page, the description panel should be empty.\n\nExpected Visual Behavior:\n\nWhen navigating to Page 2, the 2 selected violations should appear with their boxes visually selected (checked/highlighted).\n\nThe severity counters and description list must update accordingly when toggling filters or pages.\n\nIf a user unchecks any violation box, the system should auto-switch to the ‚ÄúSelected Violations‚Äù filter and update counts and descriptions based on the new total.\n\nüéØ What We Need From You First\nBefore writing or changing any code, please:\n\nAnalyze all files and logic you have access to.\n\nConsider all related components: viewer navigation, filter buttons, VIOBOX selection status, severity counters, description list, and filter logic memory across page changes.\n\nReturn a clear, bulletproof logic flow that describes how the system should behave in:\n\nInitial load\n\nPage changes\n\nFilter changes\n\nManual selection/unselection\n\nSyncing between filters, pages, boxes, and summaries\n\nLabel this logic plan ‚ÄúVioBox Selection & Filter Logic v1‚Äù and return it for review only.

I marked those accounts that way because the creditors simply stopped reporting ‚Äî often due to legal limits (like the 7-year rule) or suppression by credit bureaus.\n\nHowever, what raises concern here is the **selective pattern**: many of these accounts ceased reporting **after the Chapter 13 discharge** and **without correcting misreporting** ‚Äî suggesting a possible strategy to evade compliance.\n\nPlease treat this as a **‚Äústrategic cessation‚Äù pattern** ‚Äî not inherently illegal, but suspicious when:\n- It overlaps with proven FCRA violations from the same creditor\n- It occurs across multiple furnishers simultaneously\n- It follows known disputes or evidence of harm\n\n‚úÖ Action:\n- You do not need to update `violations-processed.json` unless language needs adjustment to reflect this nuance.\n- Let me know if any other existing files (e.g., `MED_v4_changelog.md`, `matters-content.json`) require updates to align with this clarified interpretation.\n\n---\n\nüîπ **Clarification #2: Citizens Bank Accounts ‚Äì Missing Emotional Impact Letters**\n\nMED3 and MED4 show two Citizens Bank accounts:\n- Citizens 1 (Account ending in 7849)\n- Citizens 2 (Account ending in 8116)\n\nThere are currently **no emotional impact letters or ‚ÄúWhy This Document Matters‚Äù summaries** for these two accounts.

This system identifies, classifies, and presents credit reporting violations using exact coordinates on PNG versions of credit reports. Each Viobox represents a known or suspected FCRA violation, with:\n\nX,Y,W,H pixel coordinates on the credit report image\n\nCreditor code (e.g., AL for Ally)\n\nBureau (EQ/EX/TU)\n\nReport date (e.g., 2024-04-25)\n\nWe‚Äôve pre-written standard violation descriptions for 99% of recurring data elements found in reports from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, all centered on my bankruptcy discharge and post-discharge reporting violations.\n\nThese pre-written entries include:\n\nThe field name shown on the credit report (e.g., \"Account Status: INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13\")\n\nThe FCRA statute(s) we determined apply (e.g., ¬ß1681c(f), ¬ß1681e(b))\n\nA description for reviewers and attorneys (e.g., \"Account misreported as active in Chapter 13 after discharge\")\n\nüìå LEGAL TRIGGER: FEBRUARY 9, 2024\nThis date is the confirmed discharge date of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy. It is the legal threshold that separates protected bankruptcy-era reporting from mandatory post-discharge accuracy.\n\nAny creditor or bureau reporting after this date has an affirmative legal duty to:\n\nRemove or update bankruptcy-related notations (e.g., ‚ÄúIncluded in Chapter 13‚Äù)\n\nStop reporting delinquencies or balances that were discharged\n\nReflect account closure, $0 balance, or ‚ÄúDischarged through Chapter 13‚Äù\n\nUpdate all fields (Status, Balance, Payment, Remarks, Dates) to align with the discharge\n\nAny failure to do so after this date is either:\n\nNegligent (¬ß1681o) or\n\nWillful (¬ß1681n) noncompliance,\ndepending on the presence of continued monthly reporting or updates.\n\nüß† YOUR TASK: FCRA REASONING & DESCRIPTION VALIDATION\nGo field by field using the tables below. For each violation entry:\n\nAssess the FCRA code(s) listed. Are they the most precise?\n\nEnhance or revise the written descriptions if needed ‚Äî for clarity, legal specificity, or force.\n\nConsider severity and whether additional violations may apply.\n\nSuggest any new FCRA codes or notes where patterns suggest willfulness, repeated monthly reporting, or knowledge of discharge.\n\nIf anything is missing from our existing list of standardized descriptions, recommend additions.\n\nüìã VIOLATION TEMPLATES (BY BUREAU)\nüîµ TransUnion\nField    Statute(s)    Description\nDate Updated: 02/19/2024    ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A), ¬ß1681e(b)    Date updated but data still inaccurate\nPay Status: \"Account Included in Bankruptcy\"    ¬ß1681c(f), ¬ß1681e(b)    Misleading status post-discharge\nDate Closed: 02/19/2024    ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A), ¬ß1681e(b)    Wrong or backdated closure\nRemarks: \"CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY\"    ¬ß1681c(f), ¬ß1681e(b)    Misreported bankruptcy notation\nOn Record Until: 09/2025    ¬ß1681e(b), ¬ß1681c(a)(1)    Incorrect or outdated removal date\n\nüü† Experian\nField    Statute(s)    Description\nStatus: \"Discharged through Bankruptcy Chapter 13\"    ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A), ¬ß1681c(a)(4), ¬ß1681e(b)    Status fails to reflect discharge update\nStatus Updated: Oct 2018    ¬ß1681c(a)(4), ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A)    Stale 'Status Updated' field from years earlier\nBalance: -    ¬ß1681e(b), ¬ß1681c(f)    Missing balance value post-discharge\nBalance Updated: -    ¬ß1681e(b), ¬ß1681c(a)(4)    No recent balance update post-discharge\nRecent Payment: -    ¬ß1681e(b)    Missing/blank payment activity\nMonthly Payment: -    ¬ß1681e(b)    Monthly payment field missing\nHighest Balance: -    ¬ß1681e(b)    Missing highest balance field\nOn Record Until: Oct 2025    ¬ß1681e(b), ¬ß1681c(a)(1)    Incorrect or outdated removal date\n\nüî¥ Equifax\nField    Statute(s)    Description\nAccount Status: INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13    ¬ß1681c(f), ¬ß1681e(b)    Account misreported as active in Chapter 13 after discharge\nReported Balance: $0    ¬ß1681e(b), ¬ß1681c(f)    Zero balance misreported with discharge context\nAvailable Credit    ¬ß1681e(b)    Available credit field inaccurate or blank\nHigh Credit    ¬ß1681e(b)    High credit not accurately reflected\nCredit Limit    ¬ß1681e(b)    Missing or inaccurate limit field\nBalance: $0    ¬ß1681e(b), ¬ß1681c(f)    Blank or false balance after discharge\nDate Reported: Oct 25, 2018    ¬ß1681c(a)(4), ¬ß1681e(b)    Frozen/stale date from pre-discharge era\nBankruptcy Chapter 13    ¬ß1681c(f), ¬ß1681e(b)    Incorrect bankruptcy reporting\nBankruptcy Completed    ¬ß1681e(b)    Status not updated after discharge\n\nüìé ADDITIONAL FILES AVAILABLE\nI can supply the following upon request:\n\n‚úÖ Full credit report PDFs and PNGs across 13 creditors\n\n‚úÖ Master Evidence Data CSV with violation flags and timeline mapping\n\n‚úÖ All original documents supporting harm, denials, and reinvestigation failures\n\n‚úÖ Source code for Viotagger and export structure to Airtable or JSON\n\nLet me know what else you need to complete your audit."
