Currently, the image is compressed and misaligned, which breaks the pixel-accurate positioning of violation boxes. This is unacceptable.\n\nHere are the detailed instructions:\n\n🧱 CONTAINER STRUCTURE RULES\n.report-canvas-container should act as the outer wrapper, with fixed dimensions to contain the scaled image.\n\n.report-canvas must not constrain size. It must match the natural image resolution (typically 1920×1080 px).\n\n.report-image (the PNG) must:\n\nRender at its native resolution (1920×1080)\n\nNever be scaled, squished, or resized via CSS\n\nMust not be limited by its container’s max-width or max-height\n\n🛑 DO NOT:\nDo not apply overflow: hidden to any parent of .viobox-container\n\nDo not constrain width/height of .report-canvas to arbitrary values like 810x920px\n\nDo not apply transform: scale(...) to .report-image or its container unless it is global and uniform\n\n✅ DO:\nMatch the .report-image scale and aspect ratio to the exact resolution of the PNG (e.g., 1920x1080)\n\nEnsure that .viobox-container overlays precisely over .report-image using position: absolute with top/left = 0\n\nUse transform-origin: top left and transform: scale(...) only if you are applying a uniform global zoom — otherwise remove all transforms\n\nAll vioboxes must stay in 1:1 alignment with the report image, both during drag and after export (x, y, width, height)\n\n💡 GENERAL REQUIREMENT\nThe goal is perfect 1:1 alignment between the credit report page as it appears in Viotagger and how it exists in the raw PNG file. What users see and what they tag must match exactly.\n\nUse this baseline reference image for correction:\nCorrect sample: AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P57.png (1920×1080)\nCompare with the broken versions shown in the staging environment.\n\nOnce corrected, confirm:\n\nNo scrunching or squishing\n\nNo hidden overflow\n\nNo mismatch in box alignment\n\nSnap positions (e.g., EQ-A, EQ-B) line up accurately over the text\n\n"

The visual overlays (`.viobox` elements) are currently being compressed due to a container issue.\n\n---\n\n✅ STRUCTURAL RULES:\n\n1. You may access and modify:\n   - `/index.html`\n   - `/css/refactor-ui.css`\n   - Any JS files **only if needed to correct coordinate container mismatch** (not logic)\n\n2. You may NOT:\n   - Modify any VioTagger code or layout (`.tagger-*` classes)\n   - Touch SNAP POS logic or transform math\n   - Modify the `canvas-sync.js` or overlay drawing functions\n   - Affect responsiveness or break mobile layout rules\n\n---\n\n🔍 Context:\n\nIn the Report View:\n- `.viobox-container` is currently constrained inside a visual wrapper (peach background)\n- This causes all `.viobox` overlays to render compressed and misaligned\n- The PNG image is correct, but the overlay box layer is **not allowed to fill the full 1920x1080 space**\n\n---\n\n✅ YOUR TASK:\n\n1. Identify the container that is constraining `.viobox-container`\n2. Move `.viobox-container` outside this wrapper, or refactor its positioning context\n3. Ensure `.viobox-container` is absolutely positioned against the same reference as the PNG\n4. Both PNG and `.viobox-container` must use the same 1920x1080 coordinate space and transform scaling\n5.

We're now improving the layout, alignment, and behavior.\n\n🧱 SECTION 1 — COLLAPSED LABEL BEHAVIOR\n\n• Replace the old Lucide collapse icons entirely — they added too much complexity.\n• Instead, use **text-based collapsed labels** that appear horizontally across the top of the sidebar.\n• Each label (e.g. “Show Filters”) should:\n   - Appear ONLY when its associated section is collapsed\n   - Disappear when expanded\n   - Be clickable to toggle the section open again\n• These labels should run across a single top row (not stacked vertically).\n• Ensure label fonts are slightly smaller (approx. 8pt)\n• This row of collapsed labels should **only appear when at least one section is collapsed.** If nothing is collapsed, the row should be hidden.\n\n🧱 SECTION 2 — SPACING, PADDING, AND ALIGNMENT FIXES\n\nPlease perform the following layout updates:\n\n1. **Tighten Vertical Spacing**:\n   - Reduce gap between each stack (collapsed or expanded) to ~12–14px.\n\n2. **Fix Padding Inside Box Descriptions**:\n   - Apply 12px top/bottom and 16px left/right padding inside all sidebar box descriptions.\n   - There seems to be a problem with this working properly. Please try **three different implementation approaches** and select the cleanest and most responsive one.\n\n3. **Align Badge and Text**:\n   - The Lucide icon (severity badge) should **top-align** with the description text.\n   - The icon-text gap should be reduced slightly (e.g. 8px)\n   - The text should move a few pixels **closer to the badge** and left toward the edge — but respect the new padding.\n\n🧱 SECTION 3 — MISCELLANEOUS FIXES\n\n• **Restore all three toggle buttons**:\n   - “Filter This Report” is currently missing its expanded-state button.\n   - “Severity Summary” and “Violation Details” are also missing their expanded-state buttons.\n   - These three stacks should behave consistently with the new label/toggle logic.\n\n• **Legal Disclaimer Text**:\n   - Shrink the font size of the footer message:\n     `“Original report shown. Overlays are for legal review only, not for submission.”`\n   - Target 10pt and ensure it fits on a **single line** on most screens.\n   - It should remain fully visible and legible on all device sizes.\n\n🧠 BONUS — RESPONSIVENESS RULES\n\n• Make all layout changes fully responsive:\n   - Small devices (≤480px): Stack labels neatly, reduce spacing\n   - Medium devices (481–768px): Standardize padding and alignment\n   - Large screens (≥1440px): Apply slightly more generous spacing\n\n---\n\nOnce this is implemented, I’ll confirm before proceeding to the Viotagger canvas sync or the new CaseBuilder toggle logic.

Choose the cleanest and most cross-browser-friendly one.\nImplement that as the final fix.\n\nExample padding solution:\n\ncss\nCopy\nEdit\n.violation-box {\n  padding: 12px 16px; /* top/bottom: 12px, left/right: 16px */\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: flex-start;\n  gap: 10px;\n}\n"

This is critical to user experience and legal accuracy, so please proceed carefully and return the full logic plan first — do not make any code changes yet.\n\n🔧 Instructions\nDavid has confirmed the following facts that you must incorporate into your logic model:\n\nPage Initialization Behavior:\n\nOn page load, vioboxes are already pre-selected based on tagged violation data.\n\nFor this two-page example, Page 1 has 7 violations, and Page 2 has 2 violations, for a total of 9 violations.\n\nAll 9 are pre-selected on load, and the correct descriptions appear in the FCRA Review Summary.\n\nFilters:\nThere are currently three filters:\n\nSelected Violations\n\nTotal Violations (Default)\n\nCurrent Page Only\n\nEach needs to work in harmony with the page viewer and viobox selections:\n\nSelected Violations: Shows only the user-selected violations across all pages. Count and descriptions update accordingly.\n\nTotal Violations: Shows all violations pre-tagged on all pages, even if not currently visible due to pagination.\n\nCurrent Page Only: Shows violations on the active page, filtered by their selection status. If no vioboxes are selected on this page, the description panel should be empty.\n\nExpected Visual Behavior:\n\nWhen navigating to Page 2, the 2 selected violations should appear with their boxes visually selected (checked/highlighted).\n\nThe severity counters and description list must update accordingly when toggling filters or pages.\n\nIf a user unchecks any violation box, the system should auto-switch to the “Selected Violations” filter and update counts and descriptions based on the new total.\n\n🎯 What We Need From You First\nBefore writing or changing any code, please:\n\nAnalyze all files and logic you have access to.\n\nConsider all related components: viewer navigation, filter buttons, VIOBOX selection status, severity counters, description list, and filter logic memory across page changes.\n\nReturn a clear, bulletproof logic flow that describes how the system should behave in:\n\nInitial load\n\nPage changes\n\nFilter changes\n\nManual selection/unselection\n\nSyncing between filters, pages, boxes, and summaries\n\nLabel this logic plan “VioBox Selection & Filter Logic v1” and return it for review only. David will review and approve (or modify) before you implement anything."

Typography Consistency\nKeep font behavior stable across devices, using scalable units:\n\ncss\nCopy\nEdit\n.violation-code {\n  font-weight: 600;\n  font-size: 1rem;\n  margin-bottom: 6px;\n}\n\n.violation-description {\n  font-size: 0.97rem;\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n✅ SUMMARY OF PROTECTED INTERACTION\n🔥 Do not change the click/activation glow or animation\n\n✅ You can change padding, max-width, font-size, spacing, border-radius\n\n🔁 All other interaction/hover/focus states should remain untouched\n\n"
