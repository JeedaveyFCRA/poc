Currently, the image is compressed and misaligned, which breaks the pixel-accurate positioning of violation boxes. This is unacceptable.\n\nHere are the detailed instructions:\n\nüß± CONTAINER STRUCTURE RULES\n.report-canvas-container should act as the outer wrapper, with fixed dimensions to contain the scaled image.\n\n.report-canvas must not constrain size. It must match the natural image resolution (typically 1920√ó1080 px).\n\n.report-image (the PNG) must:\n\nRender at its native resolution (1920√ó1080)\n\nNever be scaled, squished, or resized via CSS\n\nMust not be limited by its container‚Äôs max-width or max-height\n\nüõë DO NOT:\nDo not apply overflow: hidden to any parent of .viobox-container\n\nDo not constrain width/height of .report-canvas to arbitrary values like 810x920px\n\nDo not apply transform: scale(...) to .report-image or its container unless it is global and uniform\n\n‚úÖ DO:\nMatch the .report-image scale and aspect ratio to the exact resolution of the PNG (e.g., 1920x1080)\n\nEnsure that .viobox-container overlays precisely over .report-image using position: absolute with top/left = 0\n\nUse transform-origin: top left and transform: scale(...) only if you are applying a uniform global zoom ‚Äî otherwise remove all transforms\n\nAll vioboxes must stay in 1:1 alignment with the report image, both during drag and after export (x, y, width, height)\n\nüí° GENERAL REQUIREMENT\nThe goal is perfect 1:1 alignment between the credit report page as it appears in Viotagger and how it exists in the raw PNG file. What users see and what they tag must match exactly.\n\nUse this baseline reference image for correction:\nCorrect sample: AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P57.png (1920√ó1080)\nCompare with the broken versions shown in the staging environment.\n\nOnce corrected, confirm:\n\nNo scrunching or squishing\n\nNo hidden overflow\n\nNo mismatch in box alignment\n\nSnap positions (e.g., EQ-A, EQ-B) line up accurately over the text\n\n"

Please try **three different implementation approaches** and select the cleanest and most responsive one.\n\n3. **Align Badge and Text**:\n   - The Lucide icon (severity badge) should **top-align** with the description text.\n   - The icon-text gap should be reduced slightly (e.g. 8px)\n   - The text should move a few pixels **closer to the badge** and left toward the edge ‚Äî but respect the new padding.\n\nüß± SECTION 3 ‚Äî MISCELLANEOUS FIXES\n\n‚Ä¢ **Restore all three toggle buttons**:\n   - ‚ÄúFilter This Report‚Äù is currently missing its expanded-state button.\n   - ‚ÄúSeverity Summary‚Äù and ‚ÄúViolation Details‚Äù are also missing their expanded-state buttons.\n   - These three stacks should behave consistently with the new label/toggle logic.\n\n‚Ä¢ **Legal Disclaimer Text**:\n   - Shrink the font size of the footer message:\n     `‚ÄúOriginal report shown.

This is critical to user experience and legal accuracy, so please proceed carefully and return the full logic plan first ‚Äî do not make any code changes yet.\n\nüîß Instructions\nDavid has confirmed the following facts that you must incorporate into your logic model:\n\nPage Initialization Behavior:\n\nOn page load, vioboxes are already pre-selected based on tagged violation data.\n\nFor this two-page example, Page 1 has 7 violations, and Page 2 has 2 violations, for a total of 9 violations.\n\nAll 9 are pre-selected on load, and the correct descriptions appear in the FCRA Review Summary.\n\nFilters:\nThere are currently three filters:\n\nSelected Violations\n\nTotal Violations (Default)\n\nCurrent Page Only\n\nEach needs to work in harmony with the page viewer and viobox selections:\n\nSelected Violations: Shows only the user-selected violations across all pages. Count and descriptions update accordingly.\n\nTotal Violations: Shows all violations pre-tagged on all pages, even if not currently visible due to pagination.\n\nCurrent Page Only: Shows violations on the active page, filtered by their selection status. If no vioboxes are selected on this page, the description panel should be empty.\n\nExpected Visual Behavior:\n\nWhen navigating to Page 2, the 2 selected violations should appear with their boxes visually selected (checked/highlighted).\n\nThe severity counters and description list must update accordingly when toggling filters or pages.\n\nIf a user unchecks any violation box, the system should auto-switch to the ‚ÄúSelected Violations‚Äù filter and update counts and descriptions based on the new total.\n\nüéØ What We Need From You First\nBefore writing or changing any code, please:\n\nAnalyze all files and logic you have access to.\n\nConsider all related components: viewer navigation, filter buttons, VIOBOX selection status, severity counters, description list, and filter logic memory across page changes.\n\nReturn a clear, bulletproof logic flow that describes how the system should behave in:\n\nInitial load\n\nPage changes\n\nFilter changes\n\nManual selection/unselection\n\nSyncing between filters, pages, boxes, and summaries\n\nLabel this logic plan ‚ÄúVioBox Selection & Filter Logic v1‚Äù and return it for review only. David will review and approve (or modify) before you implement anything."

              "content": "Claude, I have two clarifications and requests based on your latest audit.\n\n---\n\nüîπ **Clarification #1: ‚ÄúNot Reporting‚Äù = Legal Drop-Off vs. Strategic Exit**\n\nThe 69% ‚ÄúNot Reporting‚Äù pattern in MED4 doesn‚Äôt automatically indicate an FCRA violation. I marked those accounts that way because the creditors simply stopped reporting ‚Äî often due to legal limits (like the 7-year rule) or suppression by credit bureaus.\n\nHowever, what raises concern here is the **selective pattern**: many of these accounts ceased reporting **after the Chapter 13 discharge** and **without correcting misreporting** ‚Äî suggesting a possible strategy to evade compliance.\n\nPlease treat this as a **‚Äústrategic cessation‚Äù pattern** ‚Äî not inherently illegal, but suspicious when:\n- It overlaps with proven FCRA violations from the same creditor\n- It occurs across multiple furnishers simultaneously\n- It follows known disputes or evidence of harm\n\n‚úÖ Action:\n- You do not need to update `violations-processed.json` unless language needs adjustment to reflect this nuance.\n- Let me know if any other existing files (e.g., `MED_v4_changelog.md`, `matters-content.json`) require updates to align with this clarified interpretation.\n\n---\n\nüîπ **Clarification #2: Citizens Bank Accounts ‚Äì Missing Emotional Impact Letters**\n\nMED3 and MED4 show two Citizens Bank accounts:\n- Citizens 1 (Account ending in 7849)\n- Citizens 2 (Account ending in 8116)\n\nThere are currently **no emotional impact letters or ‚ÄúWhy This Document Matters‚Äù summaries** for these two accounts. These should be created to match the style of the other 11 letters.\n\n‚úÖ Please:\n1. Create new `\"why\"` entries in `matters-content.json` for both accounts.\n2. Use the same emotional impact tone, structure, and legal tie-ins as the other documents.\n3. Let me know if you'd like to generate full Markdown drafts of the emotional impact letters next ‚Äî I will approve that phase once summaries are written.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if either clarification requires retroactive file edits, or if you're ready to generate the Citizens emotional impact letters.\n[I"

Identify **gaps, weak points, or blind spots** in the current evidence or structure  \n   - Are there any documents missing summaries?\n   - Are any legal violations underutilized or misclassified?\n   - Are there creditors or bureaus that need deeper focus?\n\n2. Suggest **enhancements** that would strengthen legal, regulatory, or negotiation leverage  \n   - Any patterns that haven‚Äôt been called out yet?\n   - Missed opportunities to show willfulness or repeat harm?\n   - Underused documents that could boost compensation arguments?\n\n3. Recommend **next best steps** for:\n   - Legal complaint preparation\n   - Regulatory submissions (CFPB, NYDFS, etc.)\n   - Attorney onboarding or settlement positioning\n\nPlease output your findings as a clear bulleted list under:\n\n- üîç Gaps or Missing Elements  \n- ‚öñÔ∏è Legal or Strategic Enhancements  \n- üöÄ Recommended Next Steps  \n\nBe direct. Be strategic. Treat this as a final readiness check before the case enters public or legal channels.\n"
