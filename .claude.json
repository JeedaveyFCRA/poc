Should state 'Discharged' or 'Closed.' Misleads future lenders and violates post-discharge accuracy requirements.\n\nDate Closed: 02/19/2024\n§1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681e(b)\nClosure date manipulated to match update date instead of reflecting actual discharge on Feb 9, 2024. Backdating suggests intentional delay in compliance.\n\nRemarks: CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY\n§1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681e(b)\nBankruptcy remark remained unchanged after discharge. Must be updated to reflect 'Discharged through Chapter 13' or removed entirely.\n\nOn Record Until: 09/2025\n§1681e(b), §1681c(a)(1), §1681c(a)(4)\nRemoval date calculated from incorrect triggering event. Post-discharge accounts must follow the 7-year rule from date of first delinquency or discharge, whichever is earlier.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n🟠 Experian (Updated – Post-Claude Review)\n__________________________________________________________\n\nStatus: Discharged through Bankruptcy Chapter 13\n§1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681c(a)(4), §1681e(b)\nStatus field shows “Discharged,” but full account accuracy must reflect that status across all related fields — balance, payment history, and update dates. Partial compliance is misleading.\n\nStatus Updated: Oct 2018\n§1681c(a)(4), §1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681n\nStatus date frozen over 5 years before discharge. Failure to update post-February 9, 2024 indicates reckless disregard and willful noncompliance.\n\nBalance: -\n§1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681e(b)\nBalance field blank or missing after discharge. Should reflect $0 or clearly state “Discharged” to comply with post-bankruptcy accuracy obligations.\n\nBalance Updated: -\n§1681s-2(a)(8), §1681e(b), §1681c(a)(4)\nNo update date shown after discharge. Violates statutory duty to update account information and provide accurate timeline of changes.\n\nRecent Payment: -\n§1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681e(b)\nPayment history not shown. Post-discharge accounts should show last valid pre-bankruptcy activity or display “N/A” if obligation was discharged.\n\nMonthly Payment: -\n§1681e(b)\nMonthly payment field blank. For discharged debts, this should either be $0 or omitted entirely to prevent misleading payment expectations.\n\nHighest Balance: -\n§1681e(b)\nHistorical high balance missing. While less critical individually, absence of this data contributes to overall pattern of incomplete or abandoned reporting.\n\nOn Record Until: Oct 2025\n§1681e(b), §1681c(a)(1), §1681c(a)(4)\nAccount removal date miscalculated. Should reflect 7 years from discharge date (Feb 2031) or from the date of first delinquency, not arbitrary default.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\n🔴 Equifax (Updateod – Pst-Claude Review)\n__________________________________________________________\n\n\nAccount Status: INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13\n§1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681e(b), §1681n\nCRITICAL: Account falsely reports active Chapter 13 inclusion after discharge on February 9, 2024. This directly contradicts legal status and demonstrates willful noncompliance.\n\nReported Balance: $0\n§1681e(b), §1681s-2(a)(1)(A)\nZero balance shown while account status still lists active bankruptcy. This internal contradiction reveals unreliable or negligent data handling.\n\nAvailable Credit\n§1681e(b), §1681s-2(a)(1)(A)\nAvailable credit missing or inaccurate. For discharged revolving accounts, this field should show $0 or be removed entirely.\n\nHigh Credit\n§1681e(b)\nHigh credit value missing or not accurately retained. Weakens completeness and consistency of the credit file.\n\nCredit Limit\n§1681e(b), §1681s-2(a)(1)(A)\nCredit limit inaccurate or absent. Post-discharge accounts should show limit as $0 or marked closed.\n\nBalance: $0\n§1681e(b)\nDuplicate of “Reported Balance.” Should be merged or reconciled with that field. Blank or $0 balances must still match updated status fields.\n\nDate Reported: Oct 25, 2018\n§1681c(a)(4), §1681e(b), §1681s-2(a)(8), §1681n\nDate field frozen over 5 years before the discharge. This long-term failure to update demonstrates abandonment of reinvestigation duties and supports willful classification.\n\nBankruptcy Chapter 13\n§1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681e(b)\nField references bankruptcy but omits “Discharged” or closing context. Misleads users about current legal status of account.\n\nBankruptcy Completed\n§1681e(b)\nField may be technically correct but incomplete. Must explicitly state “Discharged February 9, 2024” to ensure clarity and full accuracy.\n\n\n\n[I"

The legal backbone has already been validated — now your role is to analyze, connect, and organize the documents across time, creditors, and statutes.\n\n🎯 Your Goals:\nBuild Relationships Across Evidence\n\nGroup related items (e.g., a dispute letter and the creditor’s response)\n\nLink denial letters to the specific violations or creditors that caused them\n\nIdentify cause → effect patterns (e.g., misreporting → score drop → denial)\n\nConstruct a Chronological Legal Narrative\n\nUse February 9, 2024 as the legal inflection point\n\nPlace each document on a timeline of harm and response\n\nMark which documents are pre-discharge, post-discharge, or trigger-related\n\nMap Violations to Harm\n\nMatch each creditor's violations to emotional, financial, or legal harm\n\nIdentify when a single error causes multiple downstream impacts\n\nHighlight Escalation-Ready Evidence\n\nFlag documents that strongly demonstrate:\n\nWillful noncompliance\n\nOngoing harm (e.g., repeated denials)\n\nClear financial loss or opportunity cost\n\nPrepare for System Integration\n\nStructure your findings so they can be tagged, sorted, and visualized in VioCore and VioNarrative modules\n\nUse consistent metadata: creditor, bureau, date, violation type, severity\n\n✅ Output Style (Optional Suggestions):\nIf you'd like Claude to give you structured output, suggest:\n\n✅ A summary table of document connections\n\n✅ A timeline of violations and harms\n\n✅ A relationship graph of letters → denials → impacts\n\n✅ Suggestions for evidence groupings in the UI or automation\n\n📌 Final Reminder:\nThis is not just a document review — it’s the foundation of a systemic harm narrative, ready to be used in legal action, visual storytelling, or regulatory complaints.

              "content": "✅ CLAUDE CODE REVIEW PROMPT:\nPurpose: Deep legal audit of pre-written Viotagger violation descriptions against the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) using my February 9, 2024 discharge date as the central legal trigger.\n\n🔒 SYSTEM CONTEXT\nYou are assisting in a highly structured FCRA enforcement system called VioTagger, which powers a legal-tech platform called VioVerse. This system identifies, classifies, and presents credit reporting violations using exact coordinates on PNG versions of credit reports. Each Viobox represents a known or suspected FCRA violation, with:\n\nX,Y,W,H pixel coordinates on the credit report image\n\nCreditor code (e.g., AL for Ally)\n\nBureau (EQ/EX/TU)\n\nReport date (e.g., 2024-04-25)\n\nWe’ve pre-written standard violation descriptions for 99% of recurring data elements found in reports from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, all centered on my bankruptcy discharge and post-discharge reporting violations.\n\nThese pre-written entries include:\n\nThe field name shown on the credit report (e.g., \"Account Status: INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13\")\n\nThe FCRA statute(s) we determined apply (e.g., §1681c(f), §1681e(b))\n\nA description for reviewers and attorneys (e.g., \"Account misreported as active in Chapter 13 after discharge\")\n\n📌 LEGAL TRIGGER: FEBRUARY 9, 2024\nThis date is the confirmed discharge date of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy. It is the legal threshold that separates protected bankruptcy-era reporting from mandatory post-discharge accuracy.\n\nAny creditor or bureau reporting after this date has an affirmative legal duty to:\n\nRemove or update bankruptcy-related notations (e.g., “Included in Chapter 13”)\n\nStop reporting delinquencies or balances that were discharged\n\nReflect account closure, $0 balance, or “Discharged through Chapter 13”\n\nUpdate all fields (Status, Balance, Payment, Remarks, Dates) to align with the discharge\n\nAny failure to do so after this date is either:\n\nNegligent (§1681o) or\n\nWillful (§1681n) noncompliance,\ndepending on the presence of continued monthly reporting or updates.\n\n🧠 YOUR TASK: FCRA REASONING & DESCRIPTION VALIDATION\nGo field by field using the tables below. For each violation entry:\n\nAssess the FCRA code(s) listed. Are they the most precise?\n\nEnhance or revise the written descriptions if needed — for clarity, legal specificity, or force.\n\nConsider severity and whether additional violations may apply.\n\nSuggest any new FCRA codes or notes where patterns suggest willfulness, repeated monthly reporting, or knowledge of discharge.\n\nIf anything is missing from our existing list of standardized descriptions, recommend additions.\n\n📋 VIOLATION TEMPLATES (BY BUREAU)\n🔵 TransUnion\nField    Statute(s)    Description\nDate Updated: 02/19/2024    §1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681e(b)    Date updated but data still inaccurate\nPay Status: \"Account Included in Bankruptcy\"    §1681c(f), §1681e(b)    Misleading status post-discharge\nDate Closed: 02/19/2024    §1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681e(b)    Wrong or backdated closure\nRemarks: \"CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY\"    §1681c(f), §1681e(b)    Misreported bankruptcy notation\nOn Record Until: 09/2025    §1681e(b), §1681c(a)(1)    Incorrect or outdated removal date\n\n🟠 Experian\nField    Statute(s)    Description\nStatus: \"Discharged through Bankruptcy Chapter 13\"    §1681s-2(a)(1)(A), §1681c(a)(4), §1681e(b)    Status fails to reflect discharge update\nStatus Updated: Oct 2018    §1681c(a)(4), §1681s-2(a)(1)(A)    Stale 'Status Updated' field from years earlier\nBalance: -    §1681e(b), §1681c(f)    Missing balance value post-discharge\nBalance Updated: -    §1681e(b), §1681c(a)(4)    No recent balance update post-discharge\nRecent Payment: -    §1681e(b)    Missing/blank payment activity\nMonthly Payment: -    §1681e(b)    Monthly payment field missing\nHighest Balance: -    §1681e(b)    Missing highest balance field\nOn Record Until: Oct 2025    §1681e(b), §1681c(a)(1)    Incorrect or outdated removal date\n\n🔴 Equifax\nField    Statute(s)    Description\nAccount Status: INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13    §1681c(f), §1681e(b)    Account misreported as active in Chapter 13 after discharge\nReported Balance: $0    §1681e(b), §1681c(f)    Zero balance misreported with discharge context\nAvailable Credit    §1681e(b)    Available credit field inaccurate or blank\nHigh Credit    §1681e(b)    High credit not accurately reflected\nCredit Limit    §1681e(b)    Missing or inaccurate limit field\nBalance: $0    §1681e(b), §1681c(f)    Blank or false balance after discharge\nDate Reported: Oct 25, 2018    §1681c(a)(4), §1681e(b)    Frozen/stale date from pre-discharge era\nBankruptcy Chapter 13    §1681c(f), §1681e(b)    Incorrect bankruptcy reporting\nBankruptcy Completed    §1681e(b)    Status not updated after discharge\n\n📎 ADDITIONAL FILES AVAILABLE\nI can supply the following upon request:\n\n✅ Full credit report PDFs and PNGs across 13 creditors\n\n✅ Master Evidence Data CSV with violation flags and timeline mapping\n\n✅ All original documents supporting harm, denials, and reinvestigation failures\n\n✅ Source code for Viotagger and export structure to Airtable or JSON\n\nLet me know what else you need to complete your audit."
