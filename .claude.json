It shares the same code so it cannot misalign or\n  mismatch. here are specific files written abou this:\n  \"\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\css\\shared-components.css\"\n  \"\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\css\\shared-examples.css\"\n  \"\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\js\\shared-navigation.js\"\n\nDo not make any changes on this . this is for you to completely understand the current state. Follow my instruction for changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's add the features and styling and functionality of the vioTaggers tools area of the sidebar.\n\nWe use the same size headings which you can see in the image \"\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\viotagger-sidebar.png\" \n\nthe heading \"1.select bureau and creditor to begin\" style is the same as the heading used for the report sidebar heading \"filter this report\". It uses the same CSS, sizes, position, etc. Below the heading are two side-by-side boxes (on one row) that have similar but different functionality. These boxes have the same styling to the severity summary boxes in terms of side-by-side boxes. In the first box on the left \"bureau-selector\", size is flexible but my example os 1210 px; y177 px; w109 px; h90 px (use these numbers as a guide, not absolute), these are flexible for responsive); fill based on CSS from FCRA review summary elements and visual inspection of the viotagger-sidebar.png\". bureau-selector three radio style buttons stacked on top of each other and the buttons are styled in the same way that the \"filter this report\" buttons are styled. It's a white circle with a blue outline if it is unselected, and a red circle with a blue outline if it is selected. Only one button can be selected and the choices are Equifax, then Experian, then TransUnion. \n\n\nIn the box to the right of the bureau-selector is the creditor-selector, it will be sized appropriately to fit all the buttons and the names of the buttons would be all 13 creditors all spaced out evenly, buttons the same size, and then they have all the different abbreviations for each creditor. For instance, AL is ALLY, and then BB is Best Buy, and BK is Bank of America, etc. See \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\viotagger-sidebar.png for all names.\n\nhere is more specific info:\nüß† Claude Prompt: Custom Radio-Like Selector Groups (Visual & Behavioral Spec)\nYou are implementing two custom-styled radio button groups using outlined circle selectors inside rounded rectangle containers. These are not real HTML radio inputs ‚Äî they are div-based elements that behave like radio buttons.\n\nüîò GROUP 1: Bureau Selector (Vertical Stack ‚Äì 3 items)\nLabels (in order):\n\nEquifax\n\nExperian\n\nTransUnion\n\nBehavior:\n\nOnly one option can be selected at a time.\n\nWhen clicked, the selected item shows a filled red circle (#ff0000); others show an empty circle.\n\nCircle Button Styling (all 3 options):\n\nSize: 13px x 13px\n\nStroke: 2pt solid #253541\n\nFill (selected): #ff0000\n\nFill (unselected): #ffffff (white)\n\nCircle remains centered beside text\n\nContainer Styling:\n\nRounded box: 32px corner radius\n\nFill: #e3e2e1 (which is a 30% tint of #b7b5b3)\n\nStroke: 1pt solid white\n\nBox-shadow: small, soft (outer glow style, subtle elevation)\n\nüîò GROUP 2: Creditor Selector (Grid Layout ‚Äì 13 items)\nLabels (in order):\nAL, BB, BK, BY, C1, C2, CR, DB, DL, HD, JP, MF, SR\n\nBehavior:\n\nOnly one item can be selected at a time.\n\nSelected item shows a filled red circle.\n\nOthers remain outlined (unfilled).\n\nStyling:\n\nSame as Group 1:\n\nCircle size: 13px x 13px\n\nStroke: 2pt #253541\n\nFill: #ff0000 when selected, #ffffff when not\n\nGrid layout (approximately 4 items per row, auto-wrap)\n\nContainer Styling (Same as above):\n\nRounded rectangle: 32px corner radius\n\nFill: #e3e2e1\n\nStroke: 1pt solid white\n\nBox-shadow: small and soft\n\n‚úÖ Additional Notes\nGroups are independent ‚Äî selecting one in Group 1 does not affect Group 2.\n\nText should be vertically centered next to the circle.\n\nUse flexbox or grid layout for clean alignment.\n\nOn click, the selected state should update visually and logically (update selected index/class).\n\nLet's see if you could style that first section. And the way it works is a credit bureau is selected, only one, and then the user selects a creditor. In my example, I have Equifax for the bureau and the second box is creditors. I selected AL, which is ally. When that happens, when you select both, the next stack appears as number two, \"select a report page and date\", and two side-by-side boxes (or one box appears below that heading, depending on if it's a one- or two-pager report) and you make a selection there, and you can see what they're named, e.g.\"\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\assets\\reports\\AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png\"\n\"\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\assets\\reports\\AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P57.png\"\n. And once you make a selection, immediately in the viotagger canvas displays with the selected png\nand the 3rd stack appears : here is some info about it:\n3. click & multi-drag vioboxes on page\nIMPORTANT! Once you select both a bureau (e.g., Equifax) and a creditor (e.g., AL for Ally), the next stack automatically appears:\n‚Äú2. select a report page and date.‚Äù\n\nYou‚Äôll see one or two side-by-side boxes below that heading depending on how many pages exist for that report.\nEach box is styled just like the Bureau and Creditor selectors (white background, red fill on selection, black label text).\nEach label reflects the exact PNG filename, such as:\nAL-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png\n(Example path: \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\assets\\reports\\AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png)\n\nAfter you select a report page, the canvas will load the PNG, and the Viotagger becomes active.\n\nIMPORTANT! select all violations you see for this page, then drag them onto the canvas in one motion.\nBoxes will auto-snap ‚Äî just fine-tune their vertical position as needed.\n\n(This paragraph should be set in 11pt Space Grotesk, with the word \"IMPORTANT!\" in bold red, and the rest in mixed bold/regular per the existing style.)\n\n\nüì¶ Step 3: Viobox Display Logic & Styling After Report Page Selection\nOnce a user selects both a bureau and creditor, and then selects a report page, the system will:\n\nüß† Auto-Load Vioboxes (Based on Selected PNG Page)\nVioboxes are pulled dynamically from a connected data source:\n\nCSV, Airtable, or API\n\nEach viobox corresponds to specific violations found on the selected PNG.\n\nOnly the violations relevant to the selected credit report page will appear in the list.\n\nFor example, selecting:\nLI-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png\nwould trigger loading of violation data tied specifically to that page.\n\nThese boxes serve as user prompts ‚Äî they show exactly what the user should look for on the visible credit report canvas.\n\nüé® Viobox Styling (Standard)\nEach violation box uses the following style defaults:\n\nContainer Position (reference layout only):\n\nx: 1210px, y: 488px, w: 390px, h: 32px (based on 1920√ó1080 design)\n\nMust be fully responsive, not fixed\n\nBorder Radius: 32px\n\nFill Color: #e3e2e1 (30% tint of #b7b5b3)\n\nStroke:\n\nDefault: 1pt white\n\nSelected State: 1pt #f26419\n\nBox Shadow: Small, soft outer shadow to give mild elevation\n\nLabel Text: Dark gray/black, using Space Grotesk, with optional bolding for violation subtypes (e.g., INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13)\n\nüñ± Selection Behavior\nThe user can multi-select any number of visible boxes (Shift+Click).\n\nOnce selected, the boxes are dragged as a group onto the canvas.\n\nThey will auto-snap horizontally to pre-defined SNAP POS (e.g., EQ-A, EQ-B)\n\nThe user can then fine-tune vertical position and resize as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nüß© VioTagger Canvas: Viobox Types, Behavior, and Interaction Rules\nOnce a report page is selected, the Viotagger canvas appears and enables detailed annotation. The tagging system operates as follows:\n\nüìå Viobox Types (One per Bureau)\nEach credit bureau has its own type of viobox:\n\nEQ-viobox ‚Äî for Equifax\n\nEX-viobox ‚Äî for Experian\n\nTU-viobox ‚Äî for TransUnion\n\nThese are color-coded and behaviorally distinct per bureau.\n\nüìç SNAP POS (Horizontal Snap Positions)\nEach bureau has predefined X-axis snap positions to align vioboxes consistently on the canvas. For example:\n\nEQ-A, EQ-B, etc.\n\nSimilar patterns will exist for EX and TU as needed.\n\nüìù Standardized Descriptions (Per Bureau)\nSince 99% of FCRA violations are consistent within each bureau, each bureau uses a centralized list of description types.\n\nEQ-DESC ‚Äî e.g., Included_In_Chapter_13, Charge-Off_Post_Discharge, etc.\n\nEX-DESC ‚Äî same types, matched to Experian\n\nTU-DESC ‚Äî same types, matched to TransUnion\n\n(You can list out the exact XX types under each later.)\n\nüéØ Tagging Actions and Controls\nüîπ Multi-select + Drop:\n\nUser can select multiple vioboxes (using Shift+Click) and drag them to the canvas as a group.\n\nUpon release, the vioboxes snap to their default SNAP POS.\n\nOnce placed, each viobox can be:\n\nMoved: Drag or use arrow keys ‚Üí live x, y captured.\n\nResized: Drag corner/side handles ‚Üí live width, height captured.\n\nüîπ Single-select + Drop:\n\nWorks exactly the same as above but for a single viobox at a time.\n\nüîπ Copy & Paste:\n\nCtrl+C to copy one or more selected vioboxes\n\nCtrl+V to paste onto the canvas (coordinates captured)\n\nüìê Sizing Defaults\nWidth: Bureau-specific default per viobox type (editable)\n\nHeight: Same default height across all vioboxes and all bureaus\n\nüß† Data Persistence\nAs users place and adjust vioboxes, all interaction data is stored in memory:\n\nx, y, width, height, type, description, bureau, snap_pos\n\nData is preserved until exported to CSV or synced to Airtable.\n\n[I"

Currently, the image is compressed and misaligned, which breaks the pixel-accurate positioning of violation boxes. This is unacceptable.\n\nHere are the detailed instructions:\n\nüß± CONTAINER STRUCTURE RULES\n.report-canvas-container should act as the outer wrapper, with fixed dimensions to contain the scaled image.\n\n.report-canvas must not constrain size. It must match the natural image resolution (typically 1920√ó1080 px).\n\n.report-image (the PNG) must:\n\nRender at its native resolution (1920√ó1080)\n\nNever be scaled, squished, or resized via CSS\n\nMust not be limited by its container‚Äôs max-width or max-height\n\nüõë DO NOT:\nDo not apply overflow: hidden to any parent of .viobox-container\n\nDo not constrain width/height of .report-canvas to arbitrary values like 810x920px\n\nDo not apply transform: scale(...) to .report-image or its container unless it is global and uniform\n\n‚úÖ DO:\nMatch the .report-image scale and aspect ratio to the exact resolution of the PNG (e.g., 1920x1080)\n\nEnsure that .viobox-container overlays precisely over .report-image using position: absolute with top/left = 0\n\nUse transform-origin: top left and transform: scale(...) only if you are applying a uniform global zoom ‚Äî otherwise remove all transforms\n\nAll vioboxes must stay in 1:1 alignment with the report image, both during drag and after export (x, y, width, height)\n\nüí° GENERAL REQUIREMENT\nThe goal is perfect 1:1 alignment between the credit report page as it appears in Viotagger and how it exists in the raw PNG file. What users see and what they tag must match exactly.\n\nUse this baseline reference image for correction:\nCorrect sample: AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P57.png (1920√ó1080)\nCompare with the broken versions shown in the staging environment.\n\nOnce corrected, confirm:\n\nNo scrunching or squishing\n\nNo hidden overflow\n\nNo mismatch in box alignment\n\nSnap positions (e.g., EQ-A, EQ-B) line up accurately over the text\n\n"
