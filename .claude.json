              "content": "  📋 Next Steps: Phase 3 Implementation\n\n  Here's what you need to provide to Claude in your next message:\n\n  ## Task: Implement Dynamic Report Page Selection (Phase 3)\n\n  I've completed the bureau and creditor selectors. Now I need to add the dynamic report\n   selection that appears when both are selected.\n\n  ### Requirements:\n\n  1. **Add Section 2 (Initially Hidden)**\n     - This section should appear ONLY when both bureau AND creditor are selected\n     - Add it right after the bureau/creditor section in the sidebar\n     - Initially hidden with display: none or a hidden class\n\n  2. **Section Heading**\n     - Text: \"2. select a report page and date\"\n     - Use same heading style as section 1 (class=\"tagger-section-heading\")\n\n  3. **Dynamic Behavior**\n     - Monitor changes to bureau and creditor radio buttons\n     - When BOTH have a selection, show section 2 with smooth transition\n     - Load available report files based on selection\n\n  4. **File Detection Logic**\n     - Check /assets/reports/ directory for matching files\n     - Pattern: {CREDITOR}-{BUREAU}-{DATE}-P{PAGE}.png\n     - Example: If AL (Ally) + EQ (Equifax) selected, find files like:\n       - AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P57.png\n       - AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png\n\n  5. **Display Report Options**\n     - Create selector boxes for each available report page\n     - Use same styling as bureau/creditor boxes (class=\"tagger-selector-box\")\n     - If only one page exists, show one box\n     - If multiple pages exist, show them side by side (max 2 per row)\n     - Label should show page number (e.g., \"Page 57\" or \"Page 58\")\n\n  6. **Canvas Update**\n     - When a report page is selected:\n       - Update the tagger canvas image immediately\n       - The canvas already exists with class=\"report-image\" in the tagger view\n       - Update its src attribute to the selected report file\n\n  7. **State Management**\n     - Track selected bureau, creditor, and report page\n     - Clear report selection if bureau or creditor changes\n\n  Please implement this dynamic report selection functionality.\n\n  🎯 Key Points for Phase 3:\n\n  1. Conditional Display - The section must only appear when both selections are made\n  2. File System Check - You'll need to check which report files exist for the selected\n  combination\n  3. Dynamic UI Creation - Create selector boxes based on available files\n  4. Canvas Integration - Update the existing canvas image when selection is made\n\n  After Phase 3 is complete, you'll move on to Phase 4 (VioBox Display) and then Phase 5\n   (Canvas Interaction).\n"

Please fix the\n   spacing to match the Report view sidebar.\n\n  ### Current Issues:\n  1. Section heading \"1. select bureau and creditor to begin\" has no padding\n  2. Bureau selector box touches the left edge (no left padding)\n  3. Creditor selector box touches the right edge (no right padding)\n  4. Overall spacing doesn't match Report view sidebar\n\n  ### Requirements:\n\n  1. **Analyze Report View Sidebar Spacing**\n     Look at the Report view sidebar and note the padding/margins used for:\n     - `.sidebar-top-box` content padding\n     - `.filter-counter-header` (or similar section headings)\n     - `.filter-counter-content` inner spacing\n     - Overall horizontal padding from sidebar edges\n\n  2. **Apply Consistent Padding to VioTagger**\n     - Add left/right padding to `.tagger-section-heading` to match other section\n  headings\n     - Add padding to `.tagger-selectors-container` so boxes don't touch edges\n     - Ensure vertical spacing between heading and selector boxes matches Report view\n     - Bureau box should have same distance from left edge as elements in Report view\n     - Creditor box should have same distance from right edge\n\n  3. **Maintain Responsive Behavior**\n     - Padding should scale appropriately on mobile\n     - Boxes should still stack vertically below 768px\n     - Maintain touch-friendly spacing on mobile\n\n  ### Expected Result:\n  The VioTagger sidebar should have identical padding and spacing patterns as the Report\n   view sidebar, creating visual consistency across all views.\n\n  Please update the CSS to fix these padding issues while maintaining the existing\n  functionality."

Only one button can be selected and the choices are Equifax, then Experian, then TransUnion. \n\n\nIn the box to the right of the bureau-selector is the creditor-selector, it will be sized appropriately to fit all the buttons and the names of the buttons would be all 13 creditors all spaced out evenly, buttons the same size, and then they have all the different abbreviations for each creditor. For instance, AL is ALLY, and then BB is Best Buy, and BK is Bank of America, etc. See \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\viotagger-sidebar.png for all names.\n\nhere is more specific info:\n🧠 Claude Prompt: Custom Radio-Like Selector Groups (Visual & Behavioral Spec)\nYou are implementing two custom-styled radio button groups using outlined circle selectors inside rounded rectangle containers. These are not real HTML radio inputs — they are div-based elements that behave like radio buttons.\n\n🔘 GROUP 1: Bureau Selector (Vertical Stack – 3 items)\nLabels (in order):\n\nEquifax\n\nExperian\n\nTransUnion\n\nBehavior:\n\nOnly one option can be selected at a time.\n\nWhen clicked, the selected item shows a filled red circle (#ff0000); others show an empty circle.\n\nCircle Button Styling (all 3 options):\n\nSize: 13px x 13px\n\nStroke: 2pt solid #253541\n\nFill (selected): #ff0000\n\nFill (unselected): #ffffff (white)\n\nCircle remains centered beside text\n\nContainer Styling:\n\nRounded box: 32px corner radius\n\nFill: #e3e2e1 (which is a 30% tint of #b7b5b3)\n\nStroke: 1pt solid white\n\nBox-shadow: small, soft (outer glow style, subtle elevation)\n\n🔘 GROUP 2: Creditor Selector (Grid Layout – 13 items)\nLabels (in order):\nAL, BB, BK, BY, C1, C2, CR, DB, DL, HD, JP, MF, SR\n\nBehavior:\n\nOnly one item can be selected at a time.\n\nSelected item shows a filled red circle.\n\nOthers remain outlined (unfilled).\n\nStyling:\n\nSame as Group 1:\n\nCircle size: 13px x 13px\n\nStroke: 2pt #253541\n\nFill: #ff0000 when selected, #ffffff when not\n\nGrid layout (approximately 4 items per row, auto-wrap)\n\nContainer Styling (Same as above):\n\nRounded rectangle: 32px corner radius\n\nFill: #e3e2e1\n\nStroke: 1pt solid white\n\nBox-shadow: small and soft\n\n✅ Additional Notes\nGroups are independent — selecting one in Group 1 does not affect Group 2.\n\nText should be vertically centered next to the circle.\n\nUse flexbox or grid layout for clean alignment.\n\nOn click, the selected state should update visually and logically (update selected index/class).\n\nLet's see if you could style that first section. And the way it works is a credit bureau is selected, only one, and then the user selects a creditor. In my example, I have Equifax for the bureau and the second box is creditors. I selected AL, which is ally. When that happens, when you select both, the next stack appears as number two, \"select a report page and date\", and two side-by-side boxes (or one box appears below that heading, depending on if it's a one- or two-pager report) and you make a selection there, and you can see what they're named, e.g.\"\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\assets\\reports\\AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png\"\n\"\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\assets\\reports\\AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P57.png\"\n. And once you make a selection, immediately in the viotagger canvas displays with the selected png\nand the 3rd stack appears : here is some info about it:\n3. click & multi-drag vioboxes on page\nIMPORTANT! Once you select both a bureau (e.g., Equifax) and a creditor (e.g., AL for Ally), the next stack automatically appears:\n“2. select a report page and date.”\n\nYou’ll see one or two side-by-side boxes below that heading depending on how many pages exist for that report.\nEach box is styled just like the Bureau and Creditor selectors (white background, red fill on selection, black label text).\nEach label reflects the exact PNG filename, such as:\nAL-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png\n(Example path: \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\avid_arrajeedavey\\vioverse-refactor\\assets\\reports\\AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png)\n\nAfter you select a report page, the canvas will load the PNG, and the Viotagger becomes active.\n\nIMPORTANT! select all violations you see for this page, then drag them onto the canvas in one motion.\nBoxes will auto-snap — just fine-tune their vertical position as needed.\n\n(This paragraph should be set in 11pt Space Grotesk, with the word \"IMPORTANT!\" in bold red, and the rest in mixed bold/regular per the existing style.)\n\n\n📦 Step 3: Viobox Display Logic & Styling After Report Page Selection\nOnce a user selects both a bureau and creditor, and then selects a report page, the system will:\n\n🧠 Auto-Load Vioboxes (Based on Selected PNG Page)\nVioboxes are pulled dynamically from a connected data source:\n\nCSV, Airtable, or API\n\nEach viobox corresponds to specific violations found on the selected PNG.\n\nOnly the violations relevant to the selected credit report page will appear in the list.\n\nFor example, selecting:\nLI-EQ-2024-04-25-P58.png\nwould trigger loading of violation data tied specifically to that page.\n\nThese boxes serve as user prompts — they show exactly what the user should look for on the visible credit report canvas.\n\n🎨 Viobox Styling (Standard)\nEach violation box uses the following style defaults:\n\nContainer Position (reference layout only):\n\nx: 1210px, y: 488px, w: 390px, h: 32px (based on 1920×1080 design)\n\nMust be fully responsive, not fixed\n\nBorder Radius: 32px\n\nFill Color: #e3e2e1 (30% tint of #b7b5b3)\n\nStroke:\n\nDefault: 1pt white\n\nSelected State: 1pt #f26419\n\nBox Shadow: Small, soft outer shadow to give mild elevation\n\nLabel Text: Dark gray/black, using Space Grotesk, with optional bolding for violation subtypes (e.g., INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13)\n\n🖱 Selection Behavior\nThe user can multi-select any number of visible boxes (Shift+Click).\n\nOnce selected, the boxes are dragged as a group onto the canvas.\n\nThey will auto-snap horizontally to pre-defined SNAP POS (e.g., EQ-A, EQ-B)\n\nThe user can then fine-tune vertical position and resize as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧩 VioTagger Canvas: Viobox Types, Behavior, and Interaction Rules\nOnce a report page is selected, the Viotagger canvas appears and enables detailed annotation. The tagging system operates as follows:\n\n📌 Viobox Types (One per Bureau)\nEach credit bureau has its own type of viobox:\n\nEQ-viobox — for Equifax\n\nEX-viobox — for Experian\n\nTU-viobox — for TransUnion\n\nThese are color-coded and behaviorally distinct per bureau.\n\n📍 SNAP POS (Horizontal Snap Positions)\nEach bureau has predefined X-axis snap positions to align vioboxes consistently on the canvas. For example:\n\nEQ-A, EQ-B, etc.\n\nSimilar patterns will exist for EX and TU as needed.\n\n📝 Standardized Descriptions (Per Bureau)\nSince 99% of FCRA violations are consistent within each bureau, each bureau uses a centralized list of description types.\n\nEQ-DESC — e.g., Included_In_Chapter_13, Charge-Off_Post_Discharge, etc.\n\nEX-DESC — same types, matched to Experian\n\nTU-DESC — same types, matched to TransUnion\n\n(You can list out the exact XX types under each later.)\n\n🎯 Tagging Actions and Controls\n🔹 Multi-select + Drop:\n\nUser can select multiple vioboxes (using Shift+Click) and drag them to the canvas as a group.\n\nUpon release, the vioboxes snap to their default SNAP POS.\n\nOnce placed, each viobox can be:\n\nMoved: Drag or use arrow keys → live x, y captured.\n\nResized: Drag corner/side handles → live width, height captured.\n\n🔹 Single-select + Drop:\n\nWorks exactly the same as above but for a single viobox at a time.\n\n🔹 Copy & Paste:\n\nCtrl+C to copy one or more selected vioboxes\n\nCtrl+V to paste onto the canvas (coordinates captured)\n\n📐 Sizing Defaults\nWidth: Bureau-specific default per viobox type (editable)\n\nHeight: Same default height across all vioboxes and all bureaus\n\n🧠 Data Persistence\nAs users place and adjust vioboxes, all interaction data is stored in memory:\n\nx, y, width, height, type, description, bureau, snap_pos\n\nData is preserved until exported to CSV or synced to Airtable.\n\n[I"

              "content": "✅ CLAUDE PROMPT — FIX VIOTAGGER LAYOUT MISMATCH\nYou must fix a critical issue in the Viotagger layout system: the report image shown in the viewer must match the original credit report exactly in scale, proportions, and positioning. Currently, the image is compressed and misaligned, which breaks the pixel-accurate positioning of violation boxes. This is unacceptable.\n\nHere are the detailed instructions:\n\n🧱 CONTAINER STRUCTURE RULES\n.report-canvas-container should act as the outer wrapper, with fixed dimensions to contain the scaled image.\n\n.report-canvas must not constrain size. It must match the natural image resolution (typically 1920×1080 px).\n\n.report-image (the PNG) must:\n\nRender at its native resolution (1920×1080)\n\nNever be scaled, squished, or resized via CSS\n\nMust not be limited by its container’s max-width or max-height\n\n🛑 DO NOT:\nDo not apply overflow: hidden to any parent of .viobox-container\n\nDo not constrain width/height of .report-canvas to arbitrary values like 810x920px\n\nDo not apply transform: scale(...) to .report-image or its container unless it is global and uniform\n\n✅ DO:\nMatch the .report-image scale and aspect ratio to the exact resolution of the PNG (e.g., 1920x1080)\n\nEnsure that .viobox-container overlays precisely over .report-image using position: absolute with top/left = 0\n\nUse transform-origin: top left and transform: scale(...) only if you are applying a uniform global zoom — otherwise remove all transforms\n\nAll vioboxes must stay in 1:1 alignment with the report image, both during drag and after export (x, y, width, height)\n\n💡 GENERAL REQUIREMENT\nThe goal is perfect 1:1 alignment between the credit report page as it appears in Viotagger and how it exists in the raw PNG file. What users see and what they tag must match exactly.\n\nUse this baseline reference image for correction:\nCorrect sample: AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P57.png (1920×1080)\nCompare with the broken versions shown in the staging environment.\n\nOnce corrected, confirm:\n\nNo scrunching or squishing\n\nNo hidden overflow\n\nNo mismatch in box alignment\n\nSnap positions (e.g., EQ-A, EQ-B) line up accurately over the text\n\n"

The visual overlays (`.viobox` elements) are currently being compressed due to a container issue.\n\n---\n\n✅ STRUCTURAL RULES:\n\n1. You may access and modify:\n   - `/index.html`\n   - `/css/refactor-ui.css`\n   - Any JS files **only if needed to correct coordinate container mismatch** (not logic)\n\n2. You may NOT:\n   - Modify any VioTagger code or layout (`.tagger-*` classes)\n   - Touch SNAP POS logic or transform math\n   - Modify the `canvas-sync.js` or overlay drawing functions\n   - Affect responsiveness or break mobile layout rules\n\n---\n\n🔍 Context:\n\nIn the Report View:\n- `.viobox-container` is currently constrained inside a visual wrapper (peach background)\n- This causes all `.viobox` overlays to render compressed and misaligned\n- The PNG image is correct, but the overlay box layer is **not allowed to fill the full 1920x1080 space**\n\n---\n\n✅ YOUR TASK:\n\n1. Identify the container that is constraining `.viobox-container`\n2. Move `.viobox-container` outside this wrapper, or refactor its positioning context\n3. Ensure `.viobox-container` is absolutely positioned against the same reference as the PNG\n4. Both PNG and `.viobox-container` must use the same 1920x1080 coordinate space and transform scaling\n5. Final result must match the VioTagger layout exactly\n\n---\n\nOnce you’ve located the layout issue and confirmed the correct class/structure, I will approve your fix.\n\n🔒 Do not proceed with changes until I confirm your analysis.\n[I"
