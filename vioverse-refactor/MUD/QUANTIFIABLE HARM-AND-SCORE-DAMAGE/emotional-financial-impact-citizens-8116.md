Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting - Account xxxxxx8116

Dear Citizens Bank,

I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial distress caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

1. Coordinated Pattern of Violation and Strategic Exit

Your handling of my second account ending in 8116 mirrors exactly the misconduct seen with account 7849 - false reporting of "INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13" status after discharge, followed by simultaneous cessation of all reporting without correction. This coordinated pattern across both accounts demonstrates:

- Systematic false reporting of active bankruptcy status post-discharge
- Simultaneous strategic cessation across both accounts without remediation
- Leaving false information uncorrected while going "dark" to avoid accountability
- A calculated exit strategy that prioritizes liability avoidance over consumer harm

The synchronized nature of these actions across two separate accounts eliminates any possibility of inadvertent error and points to institutional awareness of FCRA violations.

2. Double Impact on Credit Profile and Lending Decisions

Having two accounts from the same institution falsely reporting bankruptcy status created amplified harm:

- Double the derogatory account count affecting credit scoring algorithms
- Inflated debt-to-income ratios from two accounts showing unresolved bankruptcy
- Enhanced negative impact on "number of accounts with delinquency" metrics
- Compounded damage when lenders saw multiple Citizens accounts in violation

This double impact directly contributed to:
- Best Egg loan denials (April 23, 2024 and November 22, 2024)
- Capital One credit line increase denial (January 2025)
- Mortgage refinancing obstacles throughout 2024-2025
- Higher interest rates on approved credit applications

3. State-Chartered Bank Obligations and Regulatory Concerns

As a New York state-chartered institution, Citizens Bank operates under enhanced consumer protection obligations through NYDFS oversight. Your pattern of:
- Initial FCRA violations through false bankruptcy reporting
- Strategic cessation without correction
- Coordinated exit across multiple consumer accounts
- Leaving harmful information unremedied

raises serious questions about compliance with both federal FCRA requirements and New York State banking regulations designed to protect consumers from predatory or harmful practices.

4. Ongoing Harm from Unresolved Reporting

Your strategic decision to cease reporting rather than correct errors has created a unique form of ongoing harm:

- I cannot dispute tradelines that no longer exist
- The damage from your false reporting remains embedded in credit scoring models
- Other creditors and bureaus point to your historical reporting as justification
- The "ghost" of your misreporting continues affecting my creditworthiness

This tactical exit without remediation represents a sophisticated form of FCRA violation that leaves consumers without recourse while preserving the harm you caused.

5. Request for Comprehensive Resolution

Given the coordinated nature of violations across both accounts, I request that Citizens Bank:

1. Acknowledge the systematic nature of false reporting across accounts 7849 and 8116
2. Take affirmative steps to remediate all lingering effects of your misreporting
3. Compensate me for enhanced damages from coordinated violations across multiple accounts
4. Submit to NYDFS a plan to prevent future strategic cessation without correction
5. Provide written assurance that no residual negative information remains in any credit reporting system

The simultaneous cessation of both accounts after documented violations, without any attempt at correction, transforms what might have been negligent errors into a pattern suggesting willful noncompliance with FCRA obligations.

Your institution's choice to exit rather than correct has left me bearing the full weight of your reporting errors - a burden that continues to impact my financial opportunities and emotional well-being more than a year after my bankruptcy discharge.

I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.


Sincerely,


David V. Marra
