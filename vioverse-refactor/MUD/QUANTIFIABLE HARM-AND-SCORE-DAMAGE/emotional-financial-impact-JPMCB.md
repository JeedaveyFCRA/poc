Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting
Dear JPMCB Card Services,
I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial distress caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.
1. Repeated Loan Denials & Financial Barriers
Since my bankruptcy discharge, JPMCB Card Services has continued to report my account inaccurately as “Included in Bankruptcy” with an outstanding balance, despite the debt being discharged. These errors have resulted in:
April 23, 2024 & November 22, 2024: Best Egg denied my loan applications, citing a high debt-to-income (DTI) ratio caused by this false reporting.
January 2025: Capital One denied my credit line increase request, specifically citing:
“Too many seriously delinquent or derogatory obligations” from my Equifax credit report.
This derogatory information directly stems from your failure to update my account status to reflect the bankruptcy discharge, as required by law. Each rejection has caused significant stress, embarrassment, and frustration, as I am being unfairly penalized for errors beyond my control.

2. Increased Interest Rates & Financial Hardship
March 2023: Best Egg approved me for a $10,000 loan at 12.99% APR.
January 2025: Best Egg approved a second $4,000 loan but at a 13.98% APR—nearly 1% higher.
My credit profile was nearly identical between these two applications, yet I was charged a higher interest rate solely due to your inaccurate reporting. This has directly increased my borrowing costs, adding unnecessary financial strain to my life.

3. Emotional Toll & Ongoing Distress
The persistent inaccuracies on my credit report have caused significant emotional harm, including:
Severe stress and anxiety over my financial stability.
Lost sleep due to constant worry about the impact on my creditworthiness.
A feeling of powerlessness over my financial future.
I should not have to endure this emotional and financial burden when I have fully complied with my bankruptcy discharge and met all legal obligations.

4. Request for Immediate Correction & Compensation
I respectfully request that JPMCB Card Services:
Immediately correct my credit report to reflect the discharged status of my account and remove any false balances or inaccuracies.
Compensate me for the financial and emotional harm caused by your failure to accurately report my account status, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.



Sincerely,



David V. Marra
