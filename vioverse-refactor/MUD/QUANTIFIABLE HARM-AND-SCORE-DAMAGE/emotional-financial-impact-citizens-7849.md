Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting - Account xxxxxx7849

Dear Citizens Bank,

I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial distress caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

1. Strategic Cessation Without Correction

Since my bankruptcy discharge, Citizens Bank maintained false reporting of my account ending in 7849 as "INCLUDED_IN_CHAPTER_13" on Equifax before strategically ceasing all credit reporting. This pattern of reporting violations followed by sudden cessation without correction has caused significant harm:

- Your account showed active bankruptcy status months after my February 9, 2024 discharge
- You ceased reporting across all bureaus by 2025 without ever correcting the false status
- This "exit without remediation" left harmful inaccuracies on my credit profile
- Your coordinated cessation with my second Citizens account (8116) suggests awareness of reporting violations

This strategic pattern demonstrates consciousness of wrongdoing while leaving me to suffer the consequences of your uncorrected errors.

2. Contribution to Systematic Credit Suppression

Your false reporting, combined with similar violations from 12 other creditors, created a cascade of financial barriers:

April 23, 2024 & November 22, 2024: Best Egg denied my loan applications, citing high debt-to-income ratios inflated by accounts like yours falsely showing active bankruptcy status.

January 2025: Capital One denied my credit line increase request, specifically citing "too many seriously delinquent or derogatory obligations" from my Equifax credit report - the same bureau where you reported false information.

Your shorter violation period followed by strategic cessation does not diminish the harm - it amplifies concerns about your awareness of FCRA obligations and deliberate choice to exit rather than correct.

3. Regulatory Oversight and Enhanced Obligations

As a state-chartered bank subject to New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) oversight, Citizens Bank has heightened obligations to New York consumers. Your pattern of false reporting followed by strategic cessation without correction raises serious regulatory compliance concerns that extend beyond FCRA to state consumer protection laws.

4. Emotional and Ongoing Financial Impact

The cumulative effect of your misreporting, particularly when multiplied across two accounts, has caused:
- Severe anxiety about my financial future and creditworthiness
- Frustration from being penalized for debts legally discharged in bankruptcy
- Ongoing higher interest rates on approved credit due to suppressed scores
- Lost opportunities from credit denials directly tied to false reporting

Your decision to cease reporting without correction leaves me in limbo - unable to dispute non-existent tradelines while still suffering from the damage you caused.

5. Request for Accountability and Remediation

I respectfully request that Citizens Bank:
1. Acknowledge the harm caused by false reporting followed by strategic cessation
2. Work with credit bureaus to ensure any residual impact from your misreporting is fully remediated
3. Compensate me for the financial and emotional harm caused by your failure to accurately report my account status as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
4. Implement procedures to prevent strategic cessation without correction in response to bankruptcy discharges

The pattern of brief violations followed by exit without correction suggests a calculated approach to minimize liability while maximizing consumer harm. This conduct violates both federal FCRA requirements and the consumer protection standards expected of New York state-chartered financial institutions.

I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.


Sincerely,


David V. Marra
