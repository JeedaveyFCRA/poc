Best Egg Denial ‚Äì April 23, 2024
Credit denial following false delinquency reporting in pre-discharge period
Summary
This notice from Best Egg, dated April 23, 2024, states that my application was denied due to serious delinquency, excessive balances, and derogatory public records. The credit score used was 632 (Experian), which reflects the damage caused by inaccurate credit reporting in the months leading up to my bankruptcy discharge. The denial confirms that key factors such as "public record," "high utilization," and "number of delinquencies" were still affecting lending decisions.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports ongoing harm caused by violations of FCRA ¬ß1681e(b) (failure to maintain maximum accuracy) and potentially FCRA ¬ß1681s-2(a) (continued false reporting post-confirmation). The denial aligns with other negative outcomes in early 2024, showing a pattern of credit suppression tied to creditor misreporting.

Timeline Placement
üî¥ Post-Discharge (Early) ‚Äì Discharge occurred February 9, 2024. This denial occurred 2.5 months later.

Best Egg Denial ‚Äì November 22, 2024
Loan application denied based on Experian report and high debt-to-income ratio
Summary
This letter from Best Egg, dated November 22, 2024, confirms denial of my loan application due to a high debt-to-income ratio and credit score issues. The credit score used was 659 from Experian. The document shows direct causality between inaccurate reporting and my inability to access credit, even after years of rebuilding post-bankruptcy.

FCRA Relevance
This adverse action ties directly to information reported by Experian, reinforcing the connection between credit report violations and real-world harm. The denial cites score suppression factors traceable to unresolved or inaccurately reported derogatory data. It supports claims under FCRA ¬ß1681e(b) for failure to ensure maximum possible accuracy.

Timeline Placement
üî¥ Post-Discharge (Late 2024) ‚Äî Nearly 10 months after discharge, indicating ongoing harm from uncorrected reporting errors.

Harm Index
üü† Moderate ‚Äì Loan denial with suppressed score and documented reason tied to credit report data

Denial Reason:
The income is insufficient to manage the incremental total debts.
If a consumer has insufficient income to manage the current total debts, it means that a consumer has a high debt-to-income ratio, which indicates the consumer may not be able to pay back the debt on a new credit account.

Capital One ‚Äì Credit Line Increase Denial
Denial issued January 20, 2025, citing Equifax derogatories and recent usage factors
Summary
This document shows that Capital One denied my request for a credit line increase on January 20, 2025. The denial was based in part on my Equifax credit report, which allegedly contained ‚Äútoo many seriously delinquent or derogatory credit obligations.‚Äù This directly ties to the inaccurate post-bankruptcy entries still present in my file. The denial also cited low account usage and low payment amounts, despite a solid payment history over time.

FCRA Relevance
This denial reinforces that inaccurate or outdated derogatory entries on my Equifax report‚Äîspecifically from creditors who failed to update after my bankruptcy‚Äîhad a direct and adverse impact on my access to credit. This supports claims of negligent or willfully inaccurate reporting under FCRA ¬ß¬ß 1681e(b), 1681s-2(a), and 1681i.

Timeline Placement
üî¥ Post-Discharge (Late Stage) ‚Äì Occurred nearly one year after bankruptcy discharge (Feb 9, 2024), proving that the impact of erroneous reporting remained active and harmful into 2025.

Harm Index
üü† Moderate ‚Äì Financial access denied due to lingering credit report derogatories tied to FCRA violations

Cornerstone Emotional Impact Letter:

March 28, 2025

Cornerstone Community FCU
P.O. Box 380901
Bloomington, MN 55438-0901

Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting

Dear Cornerstone Community FCU,

I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial harm caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

1. Constructive Mortgage Denial ‚Äì April 2024
Your inaccurate reporting directly led to one of the most devastating financial moments in my life. Due to misreporting by Cornerstone and other creditors, my TransUnion credit score dropped by 107 points ‚Äî from a 684 in 2023 to 600 in April 2024. As a result, Rocket Mortgage referred me to their Credit Upgrade Department and blocked my refinance application unless I could raise my score to 640.

The terms of that referral required me to pay down $10,000 in personal debt I did not owe, just to meet an artificial score threshold triggered by your reporting errors. I had no such money available. Because of this, I was constructively denied the opportunity to refinance $23,000 in high-interest debt, a move that would have saved me over $1,000 per month in payments and drasticallyimproved my financial well-being. This was more than a setback ‚Äî it was a breaking point that shattered my progress and hope.

2. Continuing Credit Barriers & Higher Costs
Your tradeline continues to show ‚ÄúIncluded in Bankruptcy‚Äù without the required discharge update. This status has led to repeated denials and costlier lending terms. These include:
April 23, 2024 & November 22, 2024: Best Egg denied loan applications citing high DTI caused by your misreporting.
January 2025: Capital One denied a credit limit increase, referencing ‚Äúseriously delinquent obligations‚Äù from your tradeline.
I am being repeatedly penalized for false information that should have been corrected immediately after discharge.

3. Emotional Collapse & Mental Toll
The Rocket Mortgage incident triggered a profound emotional collapse. I experienced:
Severe anxiety, panic, and hopelessness as I realized no matter how hard I worked, I couldn't escape the damage caused by your errors.
Extreme frustration knowing I had rebuilt my credit after bankruptcy, only to be forced back into high-interest debt through no fault of my own.
Ongoing distress every time I see ‚ÄúIncluded in Bankruptcy‚Äù still reported ‚Äî knowing how much it has cost me.
The mortgage denial changed the entire trajectory of my financial recovery. It was a moment of complete devastation ‚Äî one I still feel today.

4. Demand for Immediate Correction & Compensation
I respectfully demand that Cornerstone Community FCU:
Immediately correct all inaccurate credit reporting to reflect the discharged status of my account, remove all false balances, and cease reporting any misleading statuses.
Provide compensation for the significant emotional and financial harm caused by your violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

Sincerely,

David V. Marra
