JPMCB Emotional Impact Letter:

David V. Marra
437 18th St
Niagara Falls, NY 14303

March 28, 2025

JPMCB
P.O. Box 380901
Bloomington, MN 55438-0901

Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting

Dear JPMCB,

I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial harm caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

1. Constructive Mortgage Denial – April 2024
Your inaccurate reporting directly led to one of the most devastating financial moments in my life. Due to misreporting by JPMCB and other creditors, my TransUnion credit score dropped by 107 points — from a 684 in 2023 to 600 in April 2024. As a result, Rocket Mortgage referred me to their Credit Upgrade Department and blocked my refinance application unless I could raise my score to 640.

The terms of that referral required me to pay down $10,000 in personal debt I did not owe, just to meet an artificial score threshold triggered by your reporting errors. I had no such money available. Because of this, I was constructively denied the opportunity to refinance $23,000 in high-interest debt, a move that would have saved me over $1,000 per month in payments and drasticallyimproved my financial well-being. This was more than a setback — it was a breaking point that shattered my progress and hope.

2. Continuing Credit Barriers & Higher Costs
Your tradeline continues to show “Included in Bankruptcy” without the required discharge update. This status has led to repeated denials and costlier lending terms. These include:
April 23, 2024 & November 22, 2024: Best Egg denied loan applications citing high DTI caused by your misreporting.
January 2025: Capital One denied a credit limit increase, referencing “seriously delinquent obligations” from your tradeline.
I am being repeatedly penalized for false information that should have been corrected immediately after discharge.

3. Emotional Collapse & Mental Toll
The Rocket Mortgage incident triggered a profound emotional collapse. I experienced:
Severe anxiety, panic, and hopelessness as I realized no matter how hard I worked, I couldn't escape the damage caused by your errors.
Extreme frustration knowing I had rebuilt my credit after bankruptcy, only to be forced back into high-interest debt through no fault of my own.
Ongoing distress every time I see “Included in Bankruptcy” still reported — knowing how much it has cost me.
The mortgage denial changed the entire trajectory of my financial recovery. It was a moment of complete devastation — one I still feel today.

4. Demand for Immediate Correction & Compensation
I respectfully demand that JPMCB:
Immediately correct all inaccurate credit reporting to reflect the discharged status of my account, remove all false balances, and cease reporting any misleading statuses.
Provide compensation for the significant emotional and financial harm caused by your violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

Sincerely,

David V. Marra

JPMCB – Duplicate Charge-Off Reporting (Dec 2023 & Jan 2024)
JPMCB reported the same charge-off twice, straddling the bankruptcy discharge date
Summary
This document shows two charge-off reports by JPMCB Card Services. The first was dated December 20, 2023, and the second occurred nearly one month later on January 19, 2024 — just three weeks before my bankruptcy discharge. Both reports show a balance of $742 and may suggest re-reporting of the same debt, escalating harm and misrepresentation of account status. This harmful reporting was later flagged in a Best Egg “Damaging Activity” email alert on January 17, 2024, confirming the emotional and financial damage it caused.

FCRA Relevance
These reports raise potential concerns under FCRA §1681s-2(a)(1)(A) and §1681e(b). The repeated charge-off activity could have misled creditors and contributed to adverse decisions, especially with the account in an active bankruptcy proceeding. The January 17, 2024 email alert from Best Egg independently flagged JPMCB as a source of damaging credit activity, reinforcing the evidence of harm caused by this inaccurate reporting.

Timeline Placement
🔵 Post-confirmation (during repayment) — both reports occurred while my Chapter 13 plan was still active, prior to discharge.

Harm Index
🟠 Moderate – Duplicate derogatory reporting before discharge, with unresolved balance

Dear Mariner Finance,

Mariner Finance – Duplicate Charge-Off Reporting (Dec 2023 & Jan 2024)
Reported charge-offs both before and after the new year for the same $3,556 balance
Summary
This document shows two charge-off reports for the same Mariner Finance account: one on December 31, 2023, and another on January 31, 2024. Both list a balance of $3,556. This suggests the account was re-reported in close succession, which could inflate the appearance of ongoing delinquency.

FCRA Relevance
These reports may reflect issues under FCRA §1681s-2(a)(1)(A), which prohibits continued reporting of inaccurate or duplicative information. The second report also occurred just days before the bankruptcy discharge, which further complicates its accuracy and legality.

Timeline Placement
🔵 Post-confirmation (during repayment) — both reports occurred before the bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
🟠 Moderate – Two charge-off reports in 30 days for same balance, pre-discharge
