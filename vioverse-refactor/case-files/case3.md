Rocket Loans Denial â€“ July 30, 2024
Credit denial citing Equifax-based derogatory data and low credit score post-discharge
Summary
This denial letter from Rocket Loans (Cross River Bank) states that my July 2024 loan application was denied due to serious delinquencies, a derogatory public record, and high credit utilization. The letter explicitly cites a credit score of 621 (Equifax) and confirms that Equifax was the bureau used in the decision. It represents direct evidence of post-discharge credit harm tied to inaccurate or outdated credit reporting.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports violations of FCRA Â§1681e(b) (failure to maintain maximum possible accuracy) and Â§1681i(a) (failure to correct errors after dispute). The denial occurred several months after my February 2024 discharge and reflects unresolved credit reporting issues across multiple creditors.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”´ This document belongs in the Post-Discharge Phase. It shows that inaccurate derogatory data remained on my Equifax report and resulted in a formal loan denial on July 30, 2024 â€” over five months after discharge.
