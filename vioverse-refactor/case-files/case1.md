THD/CBNA ‚Äì 90 Days Past Due Report (June 2019)
Old delinquency potentially misused in later scoring models
Summary
This document shows a 90-day delinquency reported by THD/CBNA on June 13, 2019. While this date predates the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the delinquency may still be affecting credit risk models due to continued inclusion in credit history calculations.

FCRA Relevance
While pre-bankruptcy delinquencies may be legally reportable, they must be accurate and not misleading. If the status was not updated correctly during or after the bankruptcy, it could violate FCRA ¬ß1681e(b) for continued inaccuracy.

Timeline Placement
üü° Pre-confirmation ‚Äì Reported well before bankruptcy filing and repayment plan initiation.

Harm Index
üü° Low ‚Äì Legacy delinquency with minimal standalone impact, but may compound other negative factors

Repeat public record listing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, shown on March 13, 2025 credit report PDF
Summary
This public record excerpt from TransUnion shows the continued listing of a discharged Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The entry reflects outdated and redundant information more than a year after the official discharge date, still appearing in the public records section of a March 2025 report.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports violations of 15 U.S.C. ¬ß1681e(b) and ¬ß1681c, confirming TransUnion continues to report the bankruptcy status in ways that may mislead lenders or credit decision systems well after the discharge.

Timeline Placement
üî¥ Post-Discharge (Late Phase) ‚Äì This record appears over a year after the Chapter 13 was legally discharged and long after accurate status updates were due.

Harm Index
üî¥ Extreme Harm ‚Äì The repeated public display of the bankruptcy in March 2025 increases reputational damage, affects lender perception, and shows potential systemic failure to remove outdated information.

TransUnion Public Record ‚Äì Bankruptcy Discharge ‚Äì Page 2‚Äì3
Updated March 20, 2025 report showing repeated post-discharge bankruptcy listing
Summary
This record shows TransUnion continuing to report a discharged Chapter 13 bankruptcy as of March 20, 2025, over a year after the discharge date.

Risk-Based Pricing Notice from Rocket Mortgage citing Experian score of 600
Summary
This document is a Risk-Based Pricing Notice issued by Rocket Mortgage on May 16, 2024. It discloses the credit score used to evaluate a residential mortgage application for David Marra. The score used was 600 from Experian, and the document includes a detailed explanation of how credit scores impact loan pricing. Four adverse factors are listed, directly tied to derogatory credit reporting.

FCRA Relevance
This evidence is relevant under 15 U.S.C. ¬ß1681g(f) and ¬ß1681m(h), which require creditors to disclose credit score use and adverse factors when extending credit on materially less favorable terms. It also reinforces harm caused by inaccurate or outdated derogatory tradelines reported by TransUnion and Equifax that contributed to the low score, establishing clear legal causation.

Timeline Placement
üî¥ Post-Discharge (Early Stage) ‚Äì Issued approximately 3 months after bankruptcy discharge and during initial attempts to refinance mortgage.

Harm Index
üî¥ Severe ‚Äì Credit score of 600 triggered risk-based pricing, increasing the cost of credit and reducing available loan terms.
