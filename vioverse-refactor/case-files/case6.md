Credit Report & Public Record Discrepancy Analysis
Comprehensive review of credit bureau reporting errors post-Chapter 13 discharge (February 9, 2024)
Summary
This analysis reveals significant discrepancies in how TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian are reporting accounts included in my Chapter 13 bankruptcy (filed 10/25/2018, discharged 02/09/2024). While Experian correctly shows most accounts as discharged, TransUnion and Equifax continue to report accounts as "Included in Bankruptcy" without discharge status, with outdated "Date Updated" fields (some as old as 2017), and in some cases showing incorrect balances. The public record comparison shows all bureaus acknowledge the bankruptcy filing, but only Experian and TransUnion explicitly confirm the discharge date.

FCRA Relevance
These reporting errors violate multiple FCRA provisions: §1681e(b) (accuracy requirements), §1681s-2(a) (furnisher responsibilities), and §1681i (dispute investigation requirements). The frozen tradelines with outdated information create a misleading representation of creditworthiness, particularly harmful after discharge when creditors should see a clean slate. The missing discharge notations could lead to improper denials of credit or unfavorable terms.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge (Phase 3) – These reports were pulled nearly 14 months after discharge, demonstrating persistent inaccuracies that should have been corrected during the dispute process following discharge.

Harm Index
🔴 Severe – Systemic reporting failures across multiple bureaus and creditors, with direct impact on creditworthiness assessment post-discharge

Experian FICO Score Drop – January 2024
Sudden post-confirmation decline, triggering alerts and adverse actions
Summary
This document shows a significant 41-point drop in my Experian FICO score in January 2024, bringing it to 596. This occurred immediately after my Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was temporarily reopened for administrative reasons, even though the discharge was already pending. The drop coincided with the appearance of damaging tradeline activity, which triggered alerts and future credit denials.

FCRA Relevance
This score drop highlights the downstream impact of creditor misreporting and bureau data handling failures. It supports violations of FCRA §1681e(b) (failure to ensure maximum accuracy) and §1681i (failure to reinvestigate). The presence of negative entries at this sensitive stage led to cascading financial harm, including denied applications and increased interest rates.

Timeline Placement
🟠 Post-Confirmation (Late Stage) — Occurred just weeks before my official bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
🔴 Severe – Major credit score drop triggering alerts, rejections, and financial setbacks*

Discover Bank – Double Charge-Off Reporting
(Dec 2023 & Jan 2024)
Discover Bank reported two Charge-Offs: one before and one after the bankruptcy discharge
Summary
This document shows that Discover Bank reported my account as “Charge-Off” twice: once on December 31, 2023, and again post-discharge on January 31, 2024. The second report lists a $23,816 balance — despite the account being discharged. This may constitute a serious FCRA violation and supports the case that Discover misreported one of the highest liabilities in my credit profile.

Additionally, this activity appeared in the Best Egg Damaging Activity Email on January 17, 2024 — directly confirming that the reporting triggered real-time alerts and credit harm warnings to lenders and monitoring services.

FCRA Relevance
This evidence supports legal violations under FCRA §1681s-2(a)(1)(A) and §1681e(b). It demonstrates a repeated failure to report accurate post-discharge information and shows ongoing derogatory reporting that could mislead creditors. The tie to external alerts strengthens the claim of actual impact.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge – The second Charge-Off occurred after the bankruptcy discharge date of February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
🔴 Severe – High-value balance falsely reported post-discharge, duplicate Charge-Off reporting*

Discover Personal Loans – Investigation Letter – 2025-03-28
Formal response letter confirming correction to credit report after initial denial
Summary
This document is a formal investigation response from Discover Personal Loans dated March 18, 2025. It confirms that Discover reviewed David Marra’s dispute and agreed to correct their reporting to reflect that the loan was “Discharged in Bankruptcy.” This letter is the final result of a lengthy process that began shortly after David’s Chapter 13 case was reopened and then discharged in early 2024.

📌 Why This Document Matters
This Discover investigation was the turning point that triggered David’s entire credit dispute campaign. After receiving a traumatic Best Egg “Damaging Activity” alert in January 2024 and watching his FICO scores collapse, David emailed his bankruptcy attorney Joseph DiMarco on February 8, 2024, urgently asking whether these derogatory reports were legal while his case was reopened. Soon after that, he contacted Discover to challenge the charge-off and seek a correction.

At that time, Discover stated—verbally—that they found no wrongdoing and would not update the report. Around the same time, Rocket Mortgage banker Jacob Dufurrena confirmed the damage caused by the Discover charge-off in an April 2024 email.

It wasn’t until David re-contacted Discover in March 2025 that this letter was issued—more than a year later—proving that a correction was warranted. This document not only shows that Discover had originally dismissed his concern, but also proves that the disputed reporting was inaccurate.

FCRA Relevance
This letter supports claims under FCRA §1681s-2(a)(1)(A) and §1681e(b). It shows that Discover initially failed to correct inaccurate post-bankruptcy reporting, then later acknowledged the mistake after a formal reinvestigation. The delay contributed to financial and emotional harm across 2024.

Timeline Placement
🟠 Post-Discharge Correction – Confirmed on March 18, 2025, but tied to disputes initiated shortly after discharge in February 2024.

Domestic Support Obligation Form 2830
Required form to finalize bankruptcy discharge and avoid case dismissal
Summary
This document is a formal request from David Marra’s bankruptcy attorney, dated November 16, 2023, urging him to submit the required Domestic Support Obligation Form (Form 2830). Without submitting this form, the court would be forced to close the Chapter 13 case without a discharge — requiring David to reopen the case and pay additional legal and court fees. This delay ultimately contributed to negative credit reporting in January 2024 before the discharge was finalized.

FCRA Relevance
This form provides critical context for the period of reopened bankruptcy activity in early 2024. It establishes that David’s case was administratively reopened solely to file this form. Any creditor reporting a “dismissed” status or other derogatory information during this window may be in violation of FCRA §1681s-2(a)(1)(A) and §1681e(b), since the discharge was legally in process and not reversed.

Timeline Placement
🟠 Pre-Discharge / Administrative Reopening — November 2023 form deadline; case reopened January 2024; discharge finalized February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
🟠 Moderate – Delayed discharge enabled inaccurate credit reporting in early 2024.

Subject: Urgent Notice Regarding Bankruptcy Discharge

Dear David:

You are receiving this notice because you have not yet completed one of the steps necessary to obtain your bankruptcy discharge. If you are a married couple filing jointly, each of you must complete a form.

Please Complete and Mail Back the Attached Domestic Support Obligation Form.

This form indicates that you have no unpaid domestic support obligation since the filing of your bankruptcy case. It is required of ALL Chapter 13 cases, whether or not you have ever owed alimony or child support.

The failure to file the Domestic Support Obligation form with the Court will result in the closing of your case without a discharge of your debts. If this happens, you can only obtain a discharge by re-opening the case. This will result in fees to the Court of $235 and legal fees to our office of $500. Please give this your immediate attention. You may return this form by mail, fax (716-853-1378), or email it to nmacartney@grubealaw.com.

Equifax_PublicRecord_DL_ONL
Online Equifax public record snapshot from myEquifax portal (DL_ONL), showing bankruptcy record as of August 19, 2024
Summary
This is the online version of the Equifax public record section (“DL_ONL”) retrieved from the myEquifax.com portal. It confirms that Equifax was still reporting David Marra’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy as of August 19, 2024, with limited detail and no updated status. The record lacks necessary corrections expected after discharge, including a missing status field and empty liability/exempt/asset data.

FCRA Relevance
This online public record snapshot supports claims under FCRA §1681e(b) and §1681i(a)(5)(A). The record confirms Equifax’s failure to ensure “maximum possible accuracy,” as required, and reveals insufficient information or status updates following the Chapter 13 discharge in February 2024. It also provides confirmation that the record remained visible to the public and potential creditors as of August 2024.

Timeline Placement
🟠 Post-Discharge Monitoring — Captured on August 19, 2024, more than 6 months after the official bankruptcy discharge.

Harm Index
🟠 Moderate – Confirms continued public listing of bankruptcy without status resolution, contributing to denial risks.
