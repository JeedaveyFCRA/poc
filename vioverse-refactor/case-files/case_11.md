Rocket Mortgage ‚Äì Credit Upgrade Referral Confirmation
Internal email from Rocket Mortgage (Jessica Vest) confirming credit score barrier and referral triggered by bureau misreporting
Summary
This document confirms that due to a 107-point drop in David‚Äôs TransUnion credit score ‚Äî directly caused by misreporting from 13 creditors ‚Äî he was referred to Rocket Mortgage‚Äôs Credit Upgrade Department on April 21, 2024. The referral was conditional: his score had to rise from 600 to 640, and he would need to pay off $10,000 in personal debt to qualify. This constructive denial prevented him from refinancing $23,000 in debt and forced him to continue paying nearly $1,000 more monthly under high-interest terms. The emotional and financial toll has persisted into 2025.

Why This Document Matters
üî• **This is the single most important document in David‚Äôs case.**

‚úÖ Confirms **constructive mortgage denial** despite creditworthiness.
‚úÖ Shows referral to Credit Upgrade Dept. due to **13 creditors misreporting to TransUnion.**
‚úÖ Documents credit score at **600**, requirement at **640**, and **$10,000 payoff demand**.
‚úÖ Connects to a **107-point drop** in TransUnion score tied to FCRA violations.
‚úÖ Reveals loss of $23,000 refinancing opportunity and **$1,000/month debt savings**.
‚úÖ Links to Jacob Duferrena‚Äôs confirmation and Lawrence Young voicemail.
‚úÖ David‚Äôs score had reached 684 in 2023 ‚Äî he was doing everything right.

This email is the **pivot point** where the financial harm caused by misreporting became real, ongoing, and inescapable.
FCRA Relevance
This internal email documents the **direct causal impact** of inaccurate reporting on David‚Äôs ability to refinance and escape long-term financial harm. It proves that the credit reporting failures resulted in both a constructive denial of credit and forced financial hardship. This strengthens claims under 15 U.S.C. ¬ß1681e(b) (accuracy), ¬ß1681i (reinvestigation), and ¬ß1681s-2(a) (furnisher duties).

Timeline Placement
üî¥ Post-Confirmation (Phase 1) ‚Äì Occurred during the critical window after Chapter 13 confirmation but before discharge. David was taking every step to rebuild and refinance, but bureau misreporting blocked all progress.

to me  

Hello David,

Thank you for allowing me time to dig into this more. I was able to find more information regarding our Credit Upgrade Team referral.

I can confirm that on 04/21/2024, we referred you to Credit Upgrade. To be eligible for the loan, we needed your score increase from 600 to 640.

I can confirm that you discussed paying off 10,000 in debt for the score to increase from 600 to 640.

It appears that you paid 737 to another lender/broker for an appraisal which required repairs. Our team advised that once everything was sorted, we would not charge a deposit due to being a serviced client.

This is the only additional information I was able to obtain and can provide.

Please let me know if you need anything further or have any questions/concerns.

EVIDENCE DOCUMENT
Rocket Mortgage Credit Upgrade Referral ‚Äì Impact Statement
Detailing the Financial and Emotional Consequences of Constructive Denial
Key Facts:
‚Ä¢ Date of Referral: April 21, 2024
‚Ä¢ Credit Score at Time: 600 (TransUnion)
‚Ä¢ Required Score: 640
‚Ä¢ Financial Requirement: $10,000 debt payoff
‚Ä¢ Lost Opportunity: $23,000 refinance at ~$1,000/month savings
‚Ä¢ Root Cause: 13 creditors misreporting discharged debts
Financial Impact
On April 21, 2024, Rocket Mortgage's conditional referral to their Credit Upgrade Department created an insurmountable financial barrier. Despite having a confirmed bankruptcy discharge and demonstrating creditworthiness through:

Timely post-bankruptcy payments
A previous credit score of 684 (2023)
Willingness to pay $737 for required repairs
I was denied access to market-rate financing due to a 107-point TransUnion score drop caused exclusively by creditor reporting errors. This constructive denial:

Forced continuation of high-interest debt payments ($1,000+/month)
Blocked consolidation of $23,000 in dischargeable obligations
Prevented critical home improvements (garage replacement)
Resulted in lost contractor deposits and preparation costs
Emotional and Personal Consequences
The ongoing financial strain precipitated by this referral has caused:

Marital stress from financial limitations and hidden shame
Social withdrawal due to inability to participate in activities
Health deterioration including stress-related weight gain
Career impacts from reduced professional confidence
Housing instability as needed repairs were deferred
FCRA Violations Documented
This event directly demonstrates violations of:

15 U.S.C. ¬ß1681e(b) - Failure to maintain reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy
15 U.S.C. ¬ß1681i(a) - Failure to conduct reasonable reinvestigation of disputed information
15 U.S.C. ¬ß1681s-2(a) - Furnishers' duty to provide accurate information
The documented harm directly correlates to these violations, with quantifiable damages exceeding $12,000 annually in unnecessary interest payments alone.

Conclusion
This referral was not a routine credit decision, but the direct result of systemic reporting failures. The consequences have been both financially quantifiable and personally devastating. The evidence demonstrates clear causation between creditor violations and:

The 107-point credit score drop
The constructive denial of refinancing
The ongoing financial and emotional harm
This document serves as both a personal narrative and evidentiary record of the damages incurred.

Lawrence Young ‚Äì Voicemail Transcription
Rocket Mortgage voicemail referencing prior Credit Upgrade discussions and credit denial conditions
Summary
This voicemail from Lawrence Young at Rocket Mortgage, received on March 4, 2025, confirms an ongoing dialogue regarding credit issues that prevented my refinance application from moving forward. While the voicemail itself is brief, it directly connects to a same-day 15-minute phone call in which Lawrence referenced his internal notes and confirmed that I had been advised to improve my credit score above 640 or reduce personal debt by $10,000 in order to qualify. This document helps establish the existence of specific refinance denial conditions discussed and remembered by Rocket staff.

FCRA Relevance
This evidence may be used to support claims under FCRA ¬ß1681e(b) (failure to ensure accuracy) and ¬ß1681s-2(b) (failure to investigate after notice), by demonstrating that internal documentation and verbal guidance were provided by Rocket Mortgage regarding credit barriers, which contradict the lack of written policy disclosures. It supports the narrative that inaccurate or incomplete credit data directly prevented loan approval. [Draft ‚Äì pending legal mapping]

Timeline Placement
üî¥ This document belongs in the Post-Discharge Phase. The call and voicemail occurred after my February 9, 2024 discharge and directly relate to efforts to recover financially through refinancing.

Harm Index: üî¥ Extreme Harm ‚Äì This evidence supports a major lost credit opportunity due to inaccurate or unrecoverable credit record suppression.

üìÑ Official Evidence Document Begins Below
Below is the full transcription of the March 4, 2025 voicemail from Rocket Mortgage representative Lawrence Young.

Voicemail Transcription:

March 4, 2025 ‚Äì 4:42 PM

‚ÄúHey David, it's Lawrence with Rocket Mortgage calling you back. I just wanted to follow up since I missed your call. Feel free to reach back out at 313-545-0225 ‚Äî once again 313-545-0225. Thanks, and I hope you have a good one.‚Äù

Context Note:
I returned the call the same day and spoke with Lawrence for approximately 15 minutes. During the call, he reviewed his internal notes and recalled previous discussions about my refinance application. He confirmed that I had been informed of two specific credit-related conditions: raising my score above 640 or paying down $10,000 in personal debt.

Damaging Activity Email ‚Äì Best Egg Alert
Credit alert triggered by Best Egg on January 17, 2024 listing multiple overdue or damaging accounts tied to TransUnion
Summary
This document is a financial health alert email from Best Egg, sent on January 17, 2024. It warned of ‚Äúdamaging activity‚Äù appearing on my credit report via TransUnion, including overdue payments or derogatory remarks for Discover Bank, JPMCB, Sears/CBNA, and Best Buy/CBNA. The message arrived within days of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy case being administratively closed and caused significant emotional distress. This email supports my claims of reputational and psychological harm stemming from creditor misreporting before the discharge was finalized.

FCRA Relevance
This document may be used to support claims under FCRA ¬ß1681e(b) (failure to maintain maximum possible accuracy) and ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A) (furnishing inaccurate information). The appearance of derogatory data after court closure and during the discharge process shows a harmful delay or failure to correct the record. [Draft ‚Äì pending final legal narrative]

Timeline Placement
‚ö†Ô∏è This document belongs in the Dismissal Period phase. It occurred on January 17, 2024, just days after the case was closed temporarily for filing Form DSO2830 and before the discharge was finalized on February 9, 2024.

üü† Harm Index: High Harm ‚Äì Real-time alert confirming misreporting and triggering emotional distress from false derogatory entries.

Subject line: IMPORTANT: Damaging activity has been detected on your credit report
From: Best Egg Financial Health Alert
To: David Marra
Date: Wednesday, January 17, 2024, 9:41 AM
Content: ‚ÄúDavid, your credit report needs attention.‚Äù
Entities Flagged for Damaging Activity:

JPMCB CARD ‚Äì 2024-01-17 ‚Äî Damaging Activity
SEARS/CBNA ‚Äì 2024-01-17 ‚Äî Payment Overdue
BEST BUY/CBNA ‚Äì 2024-01-17 ‚Äî Payment Overdue
DISCOVER BANK ‚Äì 2024-01-17 ‚Äî Damaging Activity
Source: Screenshot from Best Egg credit alert system (TransUnion-powered)

Explanation from David Marra:
Within days of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy case being temporarily closed for administrative reasons, I received this alert showing major derogatory events were being reported to TransUnion. It triggered a sharp credit score drop (estimated 100+ points) and caused significant emotional distress as it appeared my entire repayment history had been wiped or ignored by creditors. These types of alerts from Best Egg and others have continued since that time.

Dufurrena Acknowledgement of Referral
Internal email from Rocket Mortgage banker acknowledging Discover charge-off damage
Summary
This document contains a direct email from Jacob Dufurrena, a senior banker at Rocket Mortgage, sent on April 23, 2024. He acknowledges that a Discover Bank charge-off was damaging David‚Äôs credit and interfering with his ability to refinance. This message confirms that the charge-off was a known factor during the refinance process and supports David‚Äôs claim of harm and urgency in pursuing a resolution.

Why This Document Matters
Jacob‚Äôs email was one of the first confirmations from a lender that the Discover charge-off was harming David‚Äôs credit. This correspondence helped validate the urgency behind contacting Discover, opening a credit dispute, and ultimately launching the broader FCRA investigation. It directly supports the events described in the Discover Investigation Letter.

FCRA Relevance
This email supports David‚Äôs claim that Discover Bank‚Äôs inaccurate credit reporting had a measurable impact on his creditworthiness. It establishes a timeline of harm and corroborates that the information reported on his credit report influenced major financial decisions ‚Äî such as his mortgage refinance attempt. This bolsters claims under FCRA ¬ß1681e(b) and ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A).

Timeline Placement
üü† Post-confirmation (after case reopened) ‚Äî sent April 23, 2024, two months after the bankruptcy discharge and after David had initiated dispute efforts.

Hi David,

I received your voicemail and I wanted to make sure I returned the correspondence same day, but I realize it's almost 10pm there, so I figured an email is more appropriate than a phone call.

The Discover charge-off thing is unfortunate, but there's a silver-lining, because once they correct that, it should immediately correct your scores, without you needing to pay down balances on your own. Fingers crossed, it doesn't take them long to fix it.

Please keep me posted as updates come.

Warm regards,
Jacob Dufurrena
President's Club Banker, Rocket Mortgage
