Rocket Mortgage Denial â€“ April 2024
Refinance blocked due to inaccurate credit history and suppressed post-discharge score
Summary
This document confirms that Rocket Mortgage was unable to offer refinance options in April 2024 due to a reported credit score of 600 and inaccurate negative information, including delinquency and bankruptcy-related issues. Despite progress in rebuilding credit, the score remained too low, blocking refinance approval.

FCRA Relevance
This denial supports claims under FCRA Â§1681e(b) and Â§1681i for failure to report accurate post-bankruptcy information and failure to reinvestigate disputed entries that suppressed the score. It also supports harm claims due to suppressed access to credit caused by misreporting from multiple furnishers.

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”´ This document belongs in the Post-Discharge Phase. The refinance denial occurred after my February 9, 2024 Chapter 13 discharge, during efforts to rebuild credit and access fair lending opportunities.

ðŸ”´ Harm Index: Extreme â€“ Direct denial of refinance based on suppressed post-discharge score and credit report inaccuracies

Email to Bankruptcy Attorney Joseph DiMarco
Sent February 8, 2024 â€“ Triggered by damaging reports and major credit score drop
Summary
This email to my bankruptcy attorney Joseph DiMarco was sent urgently on February 8, 2024 â€” after my credit report began showing serious derogatory activity. I was alarmed by the Best Egg alert, which reported damaging entries from multiple creditors. My FICO score dropped by over 100 points. The email captures my growing concern about the legality of creditor reporting while my Chapter 13 case was reopened. It led to my first contact with Discover Loans, whose misreporting would later become the foundation of this case.

FCRA Relevance
This email documents the moment I became aware of potentially unlawful post-confirmation credit reporting and began seeking legal advice. It shows I acted immediately upon noticing inaccurate and damaging reporting, reinforcing the timeliness of my claims under FCRA Â§1681s-2(a)(1)(A).

Timeline Placement
ðŸ”µ Post-confirmation (during reopened case, just before discharge) â€” sent one day before the February 9, 2024 bankruptcy discharge.

ðŸ“§ Full Email Content
Subject: David Marra Chapter 13 No. B1812245K CK13

Date: February 8, 2024, 10:07â€¯PM
To: Joseph DeMarco

Dear Mr. DiMarco,

On January 26, I paid your law office $525 to reopen my Chapter 13 case (because I did not submit the signed DB2830 Domestic Support Obligation (DSO) on time in order to get the bankruptcy discharged).

Nicole acknowledged she received my signed form and I believe that you have reopened my case to submit the form.

The problem is many of my former creditors have been reporting derogatory information to the credit bureaus, which has dramatically brought down my credit score.

My question is, do I have any protections, rights, and/or recourse to fix the situation because the case has been reopened? And could I possibly sue them if they donâ€™t stop?

Thank you very much and I look forward to your response.

Here is a screenshot from my credit report.
ðŸš¨ Damaging Activity Reported (from Best Egg alert)
JPMCB Card â€“ Damaging activity detected
Sears/CBNA â€“ Payment overdue
Best Buy/CBNA â€“ Payment overdue
Discover Bank â€“ Damaging activity detected
ðŸ“Ž This email was sent before my contact with Discover Loans, who initially told me no updates would be made to my credit report. However, over one year later, they reversed their position and issued a formal correction (see letter dated March 18, 2025).
