Equifax – Bankruptcy Record – DL_PDF – 2024-04-25 – Page 78
Bankruptcy status listed as “Dismissed/Closed” instead of “Discharged” two months after discharge date
Summary
This is a scanned public record entry from Equifax showing how David Marra’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy was being reported as of April 25, 2024. The record fails to properly reflect the discharge granted in February 2024. It incorrectly lists the status as blank, and includes a prior disposition of “Chapter 13, Dismissed/Closed,” which is false and misleading given the discharge was finalized in February 2024. This version was pulled from the Equifax PDF download (DL_PDF), not the online portal.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports claims under FCRA §1681e(b) and §1681i(a). The reporting is materially inaccurate in two ways: (1) failure to include an updated bankruptcy status of “Discharged,” and (2) continued use of outdated language (“Dismissed/Closed”) implying the consumer is still liable for debts already discharged. This misreporting was visible to creditors as of April 2024 and supports David’s broader pattern of post-discharge damage.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge – Retrieved over two months after the February 9, 2024 discharge order.

Harm Index
🔴 Severe – Bankruptcy marked as dismissed/closed instead of discharged, implying continued liability to creditors.

Equifax Public Record – February 10, 2025
Bankruptcy record from Equifax report downloaded via annualcreditreport.com on February 10, 2025 (Page 67)
Summary
This page from the February 10, 2025 Equifax credit report shows continued public record reporting of David Marra’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy. The primary issue is the inclusion of contradictory or misleading status language such as “Dismissed/Closed,” which is not accurate following the February 9, 2024 discharge order.

FCRA Relevance
This reporting is a violation of FCRA §1681e(b), which requires credit furnishers to ensure maximum possible accuracy. As of this report date, the bankruptcy had been fully discharged. Continued use of outdated terms like “Dismissed/Closed” or leaving the “Status” field blank implies unresolved liability and contributes to lower credit scores and adverse credit decisions.

Timeline Placement
🟠 Post-Discharge — This report was downloaded the day after discharge (February 10, 2025) and shows failure to immediately reflect accurate public record status.

Harm Index
🔴 Moderate–Severe — Outdated or ambiguous bankruptcy status creates confusion for creditors and contributes to prolonged credit harm after discharge.
