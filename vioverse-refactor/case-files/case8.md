Ally Emotional Impact Letter:

Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting

Dear Ally Financial,

I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial harm caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

1. Constructive Mortgage Denial – April 2024
Your inaccurate reporting directly led to one of the most devastating financial moments in my life. Due to misreporting by Ally and other creditors, my TransUnion credit score dropped by 107 points — from a 684 in 2023 to 600 in April 2024. As a result, Rocket Mortgage referred me to their Credit Upgrade Department and blocked my refinance application unless I could raise my score to 640.

The terms of that referral required me to pay down $10,000 in personal debt I did not owe, just to meet an artificial score threshold triggered by your reporting errors. I had no such money available. Because of this, I was constructively denied the opportunity to refinance $23,000 in high-interest debt, a move that would have saved me over $1,000 per month in payments and drastically improved my financial well-being. This was more than a setback — it was a breaking point that shattered my progress and hope.

2. Continuing Credit Barriers & Higher Costs
Your tradeline continues to show “Included in Bankruptcy” without the required discharge update. This status has led to repeated denials and costlier lending terms. These include:
April 23, 2024 & November 22, 2024: Best Egg denied loan applications citing high DTI caused by your misreporting.
January 2025: Capital One denied a credit limit increase, referencing “seriously delinquent obligations” from your tradeline.
I am being repeatedly penalized for false information that should have been corrected immediately after discharge.

3. Emotional Collapse & Mental Toll
The Rocket Mortgage incident triggered a profound emotional collapse. I experienced:
Severe anxiety, panic, and hopelessness as I realized no matter how hard I worked, I couldn't escape the damage caused by your errors.
Extreme frustration knowing I had rebuilt my credit after bankruptcy, only to be forced back into high-interest debt through no fault of my own.
Ongoing distress every time I see “Included in Bankruptcy” still reported — knowing how much it has cost me.
The mortgage denial changed the entire trajectory of my financial recovery. It was a moment of complete devastation — one I still feel today.

4. Demand for Immediate Correction & Compensation
I respectfully demand that Ally Financial:
Immediately correct all inaccurate credit reporting to reflect the discharged status of my account, remove all false balances, and cease reporting any misleading statuses.
Provide compensation for the significant emotional and financial harm caused by your violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

Sincerely,

David V. Marra

Apple Card – Application Status (April 19, 2023)
Apple Card TransUnion Score Report – Pre-Discharge Benchmark

Summary
📊 This document shows that as of April 19, 2023—while still in Chapter 13—my TransUnion credit score was 684. Although the application for Apple Card was denied, this score reflects clear signs of credit recovery during the repayment phase. It establishes a positive baseline just 10 months before my February 9, 2024 discharge and sharply contrasts with the 107-point drop that followed due to widespread post-discharge misreporting.

FCRA Relevance
🔵 This document may be referenced to demonstrate that my credit profile was stabilizing prior to discharge. The high TransUnion score supports claims that the severe decline seen in June 2024 (577) was not a continuation of prior poor credit, but the result of inaccurate and harmful post-discharge credit reporting by multiple creditors in violation of FCRA §1681e(b). It serves as a critical anchor in my credit recovery timeline.

Timeline Placement
🔵 Post-confirmation – This document falls within the repayment period of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy, approximately 10 months before my official discharge date. It reflects a key moment of financial stability and credit improvement.

Harm Index
🟢 Reference Only – While this document does not reflect direct harm, it plays a vital role as a pre-discharge benchmark in proving that the 107-point score drop was not inevitable. It strengthens the causality argument for post-discharge reporting failures.*

*This classification may be re-evaluated based on its role in dispute letters or comparisons with post-discharge events.

Best Buy CBNA – Reported 90 Days Past Due
Best Buy CBNA Reports Account As 90 Days Past Due – 2024-01-13

Summary
This document reveals that Best Buy CBNA (via Experian) reported my account as 90 days past due on January 13, 2024. This occurred just weeks before my Chapter 13 discharge and may indicate a failure to suppress or correct derogatory status codes. This exact event was flagged in a Best Egg “Damaging Activity” email on January 17, 2024—validating the real-world credit harm caused.

FCRA Relevance
This may violate FCRA §1681c(a)(1) and FCRA §1681e(b) due to the retention and reporting of a serious delinquency too close to (and potentially after) my discharge. It reflects a failure to ensure accurate, current, and non-damaging data in accordance with my legal status. The appearance in the Best Egg alert adds an extra layer of evidence that this error had material consequences.

Timeline Placement
🔴 Post-Discharge (Early) – While the delinquency was reported in January 2024, it carried over into the post-discharge period and contributed to my June 2024 score collapse.

Harm Index
🔴 Severe – A 90-day past due mark is among the most harmful derogatory entries. It significantly contributes to credit score suppression and denial risk, and this was confirmed in real-time by a damaging activity alert.

Bank of America – Charge-Off Reporting (Dec 2023)
Bank of America flagged account as Charge-Off one month before discharge
Summary
In December 2023, one month before my bankruptcy discharge, Bank of America reported a Charge-Off with a balance of $7,270. This is one of the highest pre-discharge balances inaccurately carried forward, contributing to significant harm.

FCRA Relevance
This record may violate §1681e(b) and §1681s-2(a)(1)(A) if the status or balance was not updated post-discharge. It supports claims that creditors continued to report harmful and misleading information through the discharge period.

Timeline Placement
🔵 This document belongs in the Post-Confirmation (During Repayment) Phase.
