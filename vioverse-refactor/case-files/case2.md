Rocket Mortgage ‚Äì Internal Credit Documents ‚Äì March 2025
Internal underwriting findings showing referral due to bankruptcy and credit score issues
Summary
This document contains internal credit evaluation materials from Rocket Mortgage regarding a refinance application submitted by David Marra. The underwriting system flagged the application due to the bankruptcy reporting and referred it for manual review. The document also shows a credit score of 600 from Experian and includes specific debt verification notes that impacted eligibility and processing.

FCRA Relevance
This evidence directly supports a violation of 15 U.S.C. ¬ß1681e(b) and ¬ß1681s-2(a) by demonstrating how incorrect or outdated bankruptcy reporting resulted in a referral for manual underwriting. The document shows the applicant‚Äôs credit report was used in loan decisioning and affected access to refinancing opportunities.

Timeline Placement
üî¥ Post-Discharge (Mid Stage) ‚Äì March 2025 underwriting activity follows the Chapter 13 discharge in February 2024 and aligns with delayed or blocked access to refinancing.

Harm Index
üî¥ Extreme Harm ‚Äì The refinance application was automatically referred for manual review solely due to bankruptcy flagging, despite a successful discharge. This error impeded access to refinancing and added significant procedural burden.

Sears/CBNA ‚Äì 90 Days Past Due Report (January 2024)
Delinquency reported just 30 days before bankruptcy discharge
Summary
This document shows Sears/CBNA reporting the account as 90 days past due on January 9, 2024‚Äîexactly one month before my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge. While the balance was reported as $0.00, the delinquent status itself likely damaged my credit profile during a sensitive window of recovery. This harmful activity was independently flagged in a Best Egg ‚ÄúDamaging Activity‚Äù alert email on January 17, 2024, providing real-time confirmation of impact.

FCRA Relevance
This report may violate FCRA ¬ß1681e(b), which requires maximum possible accuracy. Reporting a 90-day delinquency just before a bankruptcy discharge‚Äîwhile showing a $0 balance‚Äîcould be misleading or unfair to creditors. The fact that this was flagged as damaging activity in a consumer alert adds additional weight to the claim of actual harm caused.

Timeline Placement
üîµ Post-confirmation (during repayment) ‚Äî reported just one month before discharge on February 9, 2024.

Harm Index
üü† Moderate ‚Äì Negative delinquency flagged shortly before bankruptcy discharge

THD/CBNA ‚Äì Emotional Impact Statement
THD/CBNA credit reporting errors ‚Äì emotional and financial impact after Chapter 13 discharge

Summary
This letter details the severe emotional and financial harm caused by THD/CBNA‚Äôs inaccurate reporting after my February 9, 2024 bankruptcy discharge. It includes documented loan denials, higher interest rates, and psychological distress directly tied to THD/CBNA‚Äôs failure to update my credit status and balance correctly.

FCRA Relevance
This document supports legal claims under FCRA ¬ß1681e(b) for failure to maintain accurate information, and ¬ß1681s-2(a)(1)(A) for furnishing data known to be inaccurate. It demonstrates direct consumer harm from THD/CBNA‚Äôs continued reporting of a discharged account as ‚ÄúIncluded in Bankruptcy‚Äù with an active balance.

Timeline Placement
üî¥ This letter belongs in the Post-Discharge Phase. It describes harm that began immediately after my Chapter 13 discharge on February 9, 2024 and continued throughout 2024 and into 2025 due to THD/CBNA‚Äôs ongoing misreporting.

Harm Index
üî¥ Extreme Harm ‚Äì This document outlines multiple denials, inflated interest rates, and emotional distress tied to THD/CBNA violations. It is one of the clearest examples of compounding harm from false post-discharge credit reporting.

THD/CBNA Emotional Impact Letter:

David V. Marra
437 18th St
Niagara Falls, NY 14303

March 28, 2025

THD/CBNA
P.O. Box 380901
Bloomington, MN 55438-0901

Subject: Emotional and Financial Impact of False Credit Reporting

Dear THD/CBNA,

I, David V. Marra, am submitting this statement to document the severe emotional and financial harm caused by your inaccurate credit reporting following my Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge on February 9, 2024.

1. Constructive Mortgage Denial ‚Äì April 2024
Your inaccurate reporting directly led to one of the most devastating financial moments in my life. Due to misreporting by THD/CBNA and other creditors, my TransUnion credit score dropped by 107 points ‚Äî from a 684 in 2023 to 600 in April 2024. As a result, Rocket Mortgage referred me to their Credit Upgrade Department and blocked my refinance application unless I could raise my score to 640.

The terms of that referral required me to pay down $10,000 in personal debt I did not owe, just to meet an artificial score threshold triggered by your reporting errors. I had no such money available. Because of this, I was constructively denied the opportunity to refinance $23,000 in high-interest debt, a move that would have saved me over $1,000 per month in payments and drastically improved my financial well-being. This was more than a setback ‚Äî it was a breaking point that shattered my progress and hope.

2. Continuing Credit Barriers & Higher Costs
Your tradeline continues to show ‚ÄúIncluded in Bankruptcy‚Äù without the required discharge update. This status has led to repeated denials and costlier lending terms. These include:
April 23, 2024 & November 22, 2024: Best Egg denied loan applications citing high DTI caused by your misreporting.
January 2025: Capital One denied a credit limit increase, referencing ‚Äúseriously delinquent obligations‚Äù from your tradeline.
I am being repeatedly penalized for false information that should have been corrected immediately after discharge.

3. Emotional Collapse & Mental Toll
The Rocket Mortgage incident triggered a profound emotional collapse. I experienced:
Severe anxiety, panic, and hopelessness as I realized no matter how hard I worked, I couldn't escape the damage caused by your errors.
Extreme frustration knowing I had rebuilt my credit after bankruptcy, only to be forced back into high-interest debt through no fault of my own.
Ongoing distress every time I see ‚ÄúIncluded in Bankruptcy‚Äù still reported ‚Äî knowing how much it has cost me.
The mortgage denial changed the entire trajectory of my financial recovery. It was a moment of complete devastation ‚Äî one I still feel today.

4. Demand for Immediate Correction & Compensation
I respectfully demand that THD/CBNA:
Immediately correct all inaccurate credit reporting to reflect the discharged status of my account, remove all false balances, and cease reporting any misleading statuses.
Provide compensation for the significant emotional and financial harm caused by your violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
I certify that the above statement is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

Sincerely,

David V. Marra
