📁 COMPONENT: sidebar-top-box-overview

🧩 CONTAINS THREE STACKED MODULES (in order of appearance):

1. ✅ `filter-counter` – displays filter options, collapses after run
2. ✅ `severity-boxes-with-toggle` – summary row(s) of violations by severity
3. ✅ `violation-details` – preloaded FCRA codes and descriptions shown on page load, collapsible

All components should:
- Use **CSS block or flex column layout**
- Collapse without breaking stacking order
- Animate with a 200–300ms vertical slide effect when possible
- Never use fixed Y-positions; rely on container flow
- Be authored in **separate READMEs**, but must remain vertically connected

🔗 Linking Strategy:
Each component should be imported into a shared wrapper (`sidebar-top-stack`) that controls vertical layout and spacing. Use margin/padding between each component—not absolute coordinates.

🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTION:

The current sidebar interface is functioning correctly, and this prompt is not intended to alter any of the existing logic, data flow, or toggle behavior.

Instead, we are now **replacing the visual presentation** of the sidebar-top-box with a new design system — using the updated visual styling, structure, and layout specifications defined in this file and the related component READMEs.

This is a **visual upgrade only**. The design shown in the accompanying screenshot represents the legacy layout. Going forward, this older layout should be replaced by the modular stack described here, without disrupting existing functionality.

✅ Retain all current logic.  
✅ Replace only the visual structure and layout using the new stack.
