# VioVerse Refactor Prototype

This folder contains all files related to the visual and accessibility overhaul of the VioVerse system. It is 100% separate from legacy code and will follow modular, accessible, and performance-optimized design principles.

## Structure

- `severity-icons-demo.html` – HTML mockup of severity icons in new accessibility-compliant format.
- `AL-EQ-2024-04-25-P57.png` – Real credit report page used as background reference for testing overlays.
- `vioverse-prototype-p1.png` – UI design snapshot exported from InDesign (P1).
- `css/` – All new CSS for the refactor (create `refactor-ui.css` inside).
- `js/` – All new JS logic (create `refactor-behavior.js` inside).

## Instructions

> All Claude-generated or manually coded elements must be placed here.  
> **Do not reference legacy folders like `/assets/`, `/components/`, or `poc-view.html`.**

This folder is dedicated to:
- Accessibility-first UI
- Performance upgrades (canvas/virtual DOM/rendering)
- WCAG AA/AAA compliance
- Modular architecture ready for real legal users
