### WORKING DIRECTORY
Always ensure your working context is:
```bash
cd /home/avid_arrajeedavey/vioverse-refactor
```

### EXAMPLE PROMPT FOR FUTURE SESSIONS
"I need help with the vioverse-refactor project. Please work ONLY within the /home/avid_arrajeedavey/vioverse-refactor/ directory. You may read files from the parent directory for reference, but DO NOT modify anything outside the vioverse-refactor folder."
